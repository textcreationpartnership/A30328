            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>REASONS Againſt the Repealing the ACTS of PARLIAMENT Concerning the TEST. Humbly offered to the Conſideration of the MEMBERS of BOTH HOUSES, at their next Meeting, on the Twenty eighth of <hi>April,</hi> 1687.</head>
            <p n="1">I. IF the juſt Apprehenſions of the <hi>Danger</hi> of <hi>Popery</hi> gave the Birth to the <hi>two Laws</hi> for the <hi>two Teſts,</hi> the <hi>one</hi> with relation to all <hi>Publick Employments</hi> in 73. and the <hi>other</hi> with relation to the <hi>Conſtitution</hi> of our <hi>Parliaments</hi> for the future, in 78. the preſent Time and Conjuncture does not ſeem ſo proper for repealing them; unleſs it can be imagined, that the <hi>danger of Popery</hi> is now ſo much leſs than it was formerly, that we need be no more on our guard againſt it. We had a <hi>King,</hi> when theſe <hi>Laws</hi> were enacted, who as he declared himſelf to be of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> by receiving the <hi>Sacrament</hi> four times a <hi>Year</hi> in it, ſo in all his <hi>Speeches</hi> to his <hi>Parliaments,</hi> and in all his <hi>Declarations</hi> to his <hi>Subjects,</hi> he repeated the Aſſurances of his Firmneſs to the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> ſo ſolemnly and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that if the ſaying a thing often gives juſt reaſon to believe it, we had as much reaſon as ever People had to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon him: and yet for all that, it was thought neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to fortifie thoſe Aſſurances with <hi>Laws:</hi> and it is not eaſie
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:101251:6"/> to imagine, why we ſhould throw away thoſe, when we have a <hi>Prince</hi> that is not only of another <hi>Religion</hi> himſelf, but that has expreſſed ſo much <hi>ſteadineſs</hi> in it, and ſo much <hi>zeal</hi> for it, that one would think we ſhould rather now ſeek a further <hi>Security,</hi> than throw away that which we already have.</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>Our King</hi> has given ſuch Teſtimonies of his <hi>Zeal</hi> for his <hi>Religion,</hi> that we ſee among all his other Royal Qualities, there is none for which he deſires and deſerves to be ſo much admired. Since even the Paſſion of <hi>Glory,</hi> of making him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the Terrour of all <hi>Europe,</hi> and the <hi>Arbiter</hi> of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> (which, as it is natural to all <hi>Princes,</hi> ſo muſt it be moſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly ſo to one of his Martial and Noble Temper) yields to his <hi>Zeal</hi> for his <hi>Church;</hi> and that he, in whom we might have hoped to ſee our <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, or our <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth revived, chuſes rather to merit the heightning his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of <hi>Glory</hi> in another World, than to acquire all the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels and Conqueſts that this low and vile World can give him: and that, in ſtead of making himſelf a Terrour to all his Neighbours, he is contented with the <hi>humble Glory</hi> of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Terrour to his own <hi>People;</hi> ſo that in ſtead of the great <hi>Figure</hi> which this <hi>Reign</hi> might make in the <hi>World,</hi> all the <hi>News</hi> of <hi>England</hi> is now only concerning the Practices on ſome fearful <hi>Mercenaries.</hi> Theſe things ſhew, that his Majeſty is ſo poſſeſſed with his Religion, that this cannot ſuffer us to think, that there is at preſent no danger from <hi>Popery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. It does not appear, by what we ſee, either <hi>abroad</hi> or at <hi>home,</hi> that <hi>Popery</hi> has ſo changed its nature, that we have leſs reaſon to be afraid of it at preſent, than we had in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times. It might be thought ill nature to go ſo far back, as to the <hi>Councils of the Lateran,</hi> that decreed <hi>the Extirpation of Hereticks,</hi> with ſevere Sanctions on thoſe <hi>Princes</hi> that failed in their Duty, of being the <hi>Hangmen of the Inquiſitors;</hi> or to the <hi>Council of Conſtance,</hi> that decreed, That <hi>Princes were not bound to keep their Faith to Hereticks;</hi> tho' it muſt be acknowledged, that we have extraordinary <hi>Memories</hi> if we can forget ſuch things, and more extraordinary <hi>Underſtandings</hi> if we do not make ſome Inferences from them. I will not ſtand upon ſuch inconſiderable Trifles as the <hi>Gunpowder-Plot,</hi> or the <hi>Maſſacre of Ireland;</hi> but I will take the liberty to reflect a little on what <hi>that Church</hi> has done ſince thoſe <hi>Laws</hi> were made, to give us
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:101251:6"/> kinder and ſofter thoughts of them, and to make us the leſs apprehenſive of them. We ſee before our eyes what they have done, and are ſtill doing in <hi>France;</hi> and what feeble things <hi>Edicts, Coronation Oaths, Laws,</hi> and <hi>Promiſes,</hi> repeated over and over again, prove to be, where that <hi>Religion</hi> prevails; and <hi>Louis le Grand</hi> makes not ſo contemptible a Figure in that <hi>Church,</hi> or in <hi>our Court,</hi> as to make us think, that <hi>his Example</hi> may not be propoſed as a <hi>Pattern,</hi> as well as his <hi>Aid</hi> may be offered for an <hi>Encouragement,</hi> to act the ſame things in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> that he is now doing with ſo much applauſe in <hi>France:</hi> and it may be perhaps the rather deſired from hence to put him a little in countenance, when ſo great a <hi>King</hi> as ours is willing to forget himſelf ſo far as to copy after him, and to depend upon him: ſo that as the <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Principles</hi> of that <hi>Church</hi> muſt be ſtill the ſame in all Ages and Places, ſince its chief pretention is, that it is <hi>infallible,</hi> it is no unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable thing for us to be afraid of thoſe, who will be eaſily induced to <hi>burn</hi> us a little here, when they are told, that ſuch fervent <hi>Zeal</hi> will ſave them a more laſting <hi>burning</hi> hereafter, and will perhaps quit all ſcores ſo entirely, that they may hope ſcarce to endure a <hi>Singing in Purgatory</hi> for all their other Sins.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. If the ſevereſt <hi>Order</hi> of the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> that has breathed out nothing but <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> ſince its firſt forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that is even decried at <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf for its Violence, is in ſuch credit here; I do not ſee any inducement from thence to perſuade us to look on the <hi>Councils</hi> that are directed by that <hi>Society,</hi> as ſuch harmleſs and inoffenſive things, that we need be no more on our guard againſt them. I know not why we may not apprehend as much from <hi>Father Petre,</hi> as the <hi>French</hi> have felt from <hi>Pere de la Chaiſe,</hi> ſince all the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference that is obſerved to be between them, <hi>is,</hi> that the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Jeſuit</hi> has much more <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Paſſion,</hi> and much leſs <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct</hi> and <hi>Judgment</hi> than the <hi>French</hi> has. And when <hi>Rome</hi> has expreſſed ſo great a Jealouſie of the <hi>Intereſt</hi> that that <hi>Order</hi> had in our <hi>Councils,</hi> that <hi>F. Morgan,</hi> who was thought to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence our <hi>Ambaſſadour,</hi> was ordered to leave <hi>Rome;</hi> I do not ſee why <hi>England</hi> ſhould look ſo tamely on them. No reaſon can be given why <hi>Card. Howard</hi> ſhould be ſhut out of all their <hi>Councils,</hi> unleſs it be, that the <hi>Nobleneſs</hi> of his Birth,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101251:7"/> and the <hi>Gentleneſs</hi> of his Temper, are too hard even for his <hi>Religion</hi> and his <hi>Purple,</hi> to be maſtered by them. And it is a Contradiction, that nothing but a Belief capable of receiving <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> can reconcile, to ſee Men pretend to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve <hi>Law,</hi> and yet to find at the ſame time an <hi>Ambaſſadour</hi> from <hi>England</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> when there are ſo many <hi>Laws</hi> in our <hi>Book of Statutes,</hi> never yet repealed, that have declared over and over again all Commerce with the <hi>Court</hi> and <hi>See</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> to be <hi>High Treaſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">V. The late famous <hi>Judgment</hi> of our <hi>Judges,</hi> who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no other way to make their <hi>Names</hi> immortal, have found an effectual one to preſerve them from being ever forgot, ſeems to call for another Method of Proceeding. The <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident</hi> they have ſet muſt be fatal either to <hi>them</hi> or <hi>us.</hi> For if <hi>twelve Men,</hi> that get into <hi>Scarlet</hi> and <hi>Furs,</hi> have an <hi>Authority</hi> to diſſolve all our <hi>Laws,</hi> the <hi>Engliſh Government</hi> is to be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after lookt at with as much ſcorn, as it has hitherto drawn admiration. That doubtful Words of <hi>Laws,</hi> made ſo long ago, that the Intention of the <hi>Lawgivers</hi> is not certainly known, muſt be expounded by the <hi>Judges,</hi> is not to be que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned: but to infer from thence, that the plain Words of a <hi>Law,</hi> ſo lately made, and that was ſo vigorouſly aſſerted by the <hi>preſent Parliament,</hi> may be made <hi>void</hi> by a Deciſion of theirs, after ſo much Practice upon them, is juſt as reaſonable a way of arguing, as theirs is, who becauſe the <hi>Church of England</hi> acknowledges, that the <hi>Chuurch</hi> has a Power in <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Rites and Ceremonies,</hi> will from thence conclude, that this Power muſt go ſo far, that tho' Chriſt has ſaid of the Cup, <hi>Drink ye all of it,</hi> we muſt obey the <hi>Church</hi> when ſhe decrees, that we ſhall not drink of it. <hi>Our Judges,</hi> for the greater part, were <hi>Men</hi> that had paſt their Lives in ſo much <hi>Retirement,</hi> that from thence one might have hoped, that they had ſtudied our <hi>Law</hi> well, ſince the <hi>Bar</hi> had called them ſo ſeldom from their <hi>Studies:</hi> and if <hi>Practice</hi> is thought often hurtful to Speculation, as that which diſorders and hurries the Judgment, they who had <hi>practiſed</hi> ſo little in our <hi>Law,</hi> had no byaſs on their Underſtandings: and if the habit of taking <hi>Money</hi> as a <hi>Lawyer,</hi> is a dangerous Preparation for one that is to be an <hi>incorrupt Judge,</hi> they ſhould have been <hi>incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible,</hi> ſince it is not thought, that the greater part of them
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:101251:7"/> got ever ſo much <hi>Money</hi> by their <hi>Profeſſion,</hi> as paid for their <hi>Furs.</hi> In ſhort, we now ſee how they have <hi>merited</hi> their <hi>Preferment,</hi> and they may yet expect a further <hi>Exaltation,</hi> when the Juſtice and the <hi>Laws of England</hi> come to be in Hands, that will be as careful to preſerve them, as <hi>they</hi> have been to deſtroy them. But what an Infamy will it lay upon the Name of an <hi>Engliſh Parliament,</hi> if inſtead of calling thoſe <hi>Betrayers of their Country</hi> to an account, they ſhould go by an after-game to confirm what theſe <hi>Fellows</hi> have done?</p>
            <p n="6">VI. The late <hi>Conferences</hi> with ſo many <hi>Members</hi> of <hi>both Houſes,</hi> will give ſuch an ill-natured piece of Jealouſie againſt them, that of all Perſons living, that are the moſt concern'd to take care how they give their <hi>Votes,</hi> the World will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that <hi>Threatnings</hi> and <hi>Promiſes</hi> had as large a ſhare in thoſe <hi>ſecret Converſations,</hi> as Reaſoning or Perſuaſion: and it muſt be a more than ordinary degree of Zeal and Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage in them, that muſt take off the Blot, of being <hi>ſent for,</hi> and <hi>ſpoke to,</hi> on ſuch a Subject, and in ſuch a manner. The worthy Behaviour of the <hi>Members</hi> in the <hi>laſt Seſſion,</hi> had made the <hi>Nation</hi> unwilling to remember the Errors committed in the <hi>firſt Election:</hi> and it is to be hoped, that they will not give any cauſe for the future to call that to mind. For if a <hi>Parliament,</hi> that had ſo many Flaws in its firſt Conception, goes to repeal <hi>Laws,</hi> that we are ſure were made by <hi>Legal Parliaments,</hi> it will put the <hi>Nation</hi> on an Enquiry that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but neceſſity will drive them to. For a <hi>Nation</hi> may be laid aſleep, and be a little cheated; but when it is awakened, and ſees its danger, it will not look on and ſee a <hi>Rape</hi> made on its <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Liberties,</hi> without examining, <hi>From whence have theſe Men this Authority?</hi> They will hardly find that it is <hi>of Men;</hi> and they will not believe that it is <hi>of God.</hi> But it is to be hoped, that there will be no occaſion given for this angry Queſtion, which is much eaſier made than an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. If all that were now asked in favour of <hi>Popery,</hi> were only ſome Gentleneſs towards the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> there were ſome reaſon to entertain the <hi>Debate,</hi> when the Demand were a little more modeſt: If Men were to be attainted of <hi>Treaſon,</hi> for being <hi>reconciled</hi> to the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> or for <hi>reconciling</hi> others to it; If <hi>Prieſts</hi> were demanded to be <hi>hanged,</hi> for ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:101251:8"/> Orders in the <hi>Church of Rome;</hi> and if the <hi>two thirds</hi> of the <hi>Papiſts Eſtates</hi> were offered to be <hi>levied,</hi> it were a very natural thing to ſee them uneaſie and reſtleſs: but now the matter is more barefaced; they are not contented to live at eaſe, and enjoy their <hi>Eſtates;</hi> but they muſt carry all before them: and <hi>F. Petre</hi> cannot be at quiet, unleſs he makes as great a <hi>Figure</hi> in <hi>our Court,</hi> as <hi>Pere de la Chaiſe</hi> does at <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Ceſſation of all Severities againſt them, is that to which the <hi>Nation</hi> would more eaſily ſubmit; but it is their <hi>Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our</hi> that muſt create them the continuance of the like Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion in another <hi>Reign.</hi> If a reſtleſs and a perſecuting <hi>Spirit</hi> were not inherent in that <hi>Order,</hi> that has now the <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendant,</hi> they would have behaved themſelves ſo decently under their preſent Advantages, as to have made <hi>our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,</hi> that have charged them ſo heavily, look a little out of countenance: and this would have wrought more on the good Nature of the <hi>Nation,</hi> and the <hi>Princely Nobleneſs</hi> of the <hi>Succeſſors</hi> whom we have in <hi>view,</hi> than thoſe <hi>Arts</hi> of <hi>Craft</hi> and <hi>Violence,</hi> to which we ſee their Tempers carry them even ſo early, before it is yet time to ſhew themſelves. The Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the <hi>Engliſh Nation,</hi> the Heroical Vertues of <hi>thoſe</hi> whom we have in our Eyes, but above all, our moſt holy <hi>Religion,</hi> which inſtead of Revenge and Cruelty, inſpires us with Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Mercy, even for Enemies, are all ſuch things, as may take from the Gentlemen of that <hi>Religion</hi> all ſad Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions, unleſs they raiſe a Storm againſt themſelves, and provoke the <hi>Juſtice of the Nation</hi> to ſuch a degree, that the <hi>Succeſſors</hi> may find it neceſſary to be <hi>juſt,</hi> even when their own Inclinations would rather carry them to <hi>ſhew Mercy.</hi> In ſhort, they need fear nothing but what they create to themſelves: ſo that all this ſtir that they keep for their own <hi>Safety,</hi> looks too like the ſecuring to themſelves <hi>Pardons</hi> for the <hi>Crimes</hi> that they intend to commit.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. I know it is objected as no ſmall Prejudice againſt theſe <hi>Laws,</hi> That the very making of them diſcovered a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Malignity againſt <hi>His Majeſty,</hi> and therefore it is <hi>ill Manners</hi> to ſpeak for them. The <hi>firſt</hi> had perhaps an Eye at his being then <hi>Admiral:</hi> and the <hi>laſt</hi> was poſſibly levelled at him: tho' when that was diſcovered, he was excepted
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:101251:8"/> out of it by a ſpecial <hi>Proviſo.</hi> And as for that which paſt in 73, I hope it is not forgot, that it was enacted by that <hi>Loyal Parliament,</hi> that had ſetled both the <hi>Prerogative</hi> of the Crown and the Rites of the <hi>Church,</hi> and that had given the <hi>King</hi> more <hi>Money</hi> than all the <hi>Parliaments of England</hi> had ever done in all former Times. <hi>A Parliament</hi> that had indeed ſome Diſputes with the <hi>King,</hi> but upon the firſt Step that he made with relation to <hi>Religion</hi> or Safety, they ſhewed how ready they were to forget all that was paſt: as appeared by their Behaviour after the <hi>Triple Alliance.</hi> And in 73, tho' they had great cauſe given them to diſlike the <hi>Dutch War,</hi> eſpecially the ſtrange beginning of it upon the <hi>Smyrna Fleet;</hi> and the <hi>ſtopping</hi> the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> the <hi>Declaration</hi> for <hi>Toleration,</hi> and the <hi>Writs</hi> for the <hi>Members</hi> of the <hi>Houſe,</hi> were Matters of hard Digeſtion; yet no ſooner did the <hi>King</hi> give them this new Aſſurance for their <hi>Religion</hi> then, tho' they had very great Reaſons given them to be jealous of the <hi>War,</hi> yet ſince the <hi>King</hi> was engaged, they gave him 1200000 <hi>Pounds</hi> for carrying it on; and they thought they had no ill Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worths for their <hi>Money,</hi> when they carried home with them to their <hi>Countries</hi> this new <hi>Security</hi> for their <hi>Religion,</hi> which we are deſired now to throw up, and which the Reverend <hi>Judges</hi> have already thrown out, as a <hi>Law</hi> out of date. If this had carried in it any new piece of <hi>Severity,</hi> their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints might be juſt; but they are extream tender, if they are ſo uneaſie under a <hi>Law</hi> that only gives them Leiſure and Opportunities to live at home. And the laſt <hi>Teſt,</hi> which was intended only for ſhutting them out from a ſhare in the <hi>Legiſlative Body,</hi> appears to be ſo juſt, that one is rather ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to find that it was ſo long a <hi>doing,</hi> than that it was <hi>done</hi> at laſt: and ſince it is <hi>done,</hi> it is a great preſumption on our Underſtandings to think, that we ſhould be willing to part with it. If it was not ſooner done, it was becauſe there was not ſuch cauſe given for Jealouſie to work upon: but what has appeared ſince that time, and what has been <hi>printed</hi> in his <hi>late Majeſty's</hi> Name, ſhews the World now, that the <hi>Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies</hi> which occaſioned thoſe <hi>Laws,</hi> were not ſo ill ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as ſome well-meaning Men perhaps then believed them to be. But there are ſome Times in which all Mens Eyes come to be opened.</p>
            <pb n="8" facs="tcp:101251:9"/>
            <p n="9">IX. I am told, ſome think it is very indecent to have a <hi>Teſt</hi> for our <hi>Parliaments,</hi> in which the <hi>King's Religion</hi> is accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of <hi>Idolatry;</hi> but if this Reaſon is good in this Particular, it will be full as good againſt ſeveral of the <hi>Articles</hi> of our <hi>Church,</hi> and many of the <hi>Homilies.</hi> If the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> of this <hi>Nation</hi> is ſo formed by <hi>Law,</hi> that the <hi>King's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> is declared over and over again to be <hi>Idolatrous,</hi> what help is there for it? It is no other, than it was when His Majeſty was Crowned, and <hi>Swore</hi> to maintain our <hi>Laws.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I hope none will be wanting in all poſſible Reſpect to His Sacred Perſon; and as we ought to be infinitely ſorry to find him engaged in a <hi>Religion</hi> which we muſt believe <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous,</hi> ſo we are far from the ill Manners of reflecting on his Perſon, or calling him an <hi>Idolater:</hi> for as every Man that reports a Lie, is not for that to be called a Liar; ſo tho' the ordering the Intention, and the prejudice of a Miſperſuaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are ſuch Abatements, that we will not raſhly take on us to call every Man of the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> an <hi>Idolater;</hi> yet on the other hand, we can never lay down our Charge againſt the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> as guilty of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> unleſs at the ſame time we part with our <hi>Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">X. Others give us a ſtrange ſort of <hi>Argument,</hi> to perſuade us to part with the <hi>Teſt;</hi> they ſay, <hi>The King muſt imploy his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Subjects, for he can truſt no other; and he is ſo aſſured of their Fidelity to him, that we need apprehend no Danger from them.</hi> This is an odd Method to work on us, to let in a ſort of People to the <hi>Parliament</hi> and <hi>Government,</hi> ſince the <hi>King</hi> cannot truſt <hi>us,</hi> but will depend on <hi>them:</hi> ſo that as ſoon as this <hi>Law</hi> is repealed, they muſt have all the Imployments, and have the whole Power of the <hi>Nation</hi> lodged in their <hi>hands;</hi> this ſeems a little too groſs to impoſe, even on <hi>Iriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi> The <hi>King</hi> ſaw for many Years together, with how much Zeal both the <hi>Clergy,</hi> and many of the <hi>Gentry</hi> appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for his Intereſts; and if there is now a Melancholy Damp on their Spirits, the <hi>King</hi> can diſſipate it when he will; and as the <hi>Church of England</hi> is a Body that will never <hi>rebel</hi> againſt him, ſo any Sullenneſs, under which the late Adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Affairs has brought them, would ſoon vaniſh, if the <hi>King</hi> would be pleaſed to remember a little what he has ſo often <hi>promiſed,</hi> not only in <hi>Publick,</hi> but in <hi>Private;</hi> and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:101251:9"/> would be contented with the Exerciſe of his own <hi>Religion,</hi> without embroiling his whole Affairs, becauſe <hi>F.

            <head>SOME REFLECTIONS On His MAJESTY'S PROCLAMATION Of the Twelfth of <hi>February,</hi> 1686/7. for a TO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LERATION in <hi>Scotland:</hi> Together with the ſaid PROCLAMATION.</head>
            <p n="1">I. THe Preamble of a <hi>Proclamation</hi> is oft writ in haſte, and is the Flouriſh of ſome wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton Pen: but one of ſuch an Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary nature as <hi>this is,</hi> was probably more ſeverely examined; there is a new Deſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of his <hi>Majeſty's Authority</hi> here ſet forth of his <hi>Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Power,</hi> which is ſo often repeated, that it deſerves to be a little ſearched into. <hi>Prerogative Royal</hi> and <hi>Sovereign Authority,</hi> are Terms already received and known; but for this <hi>Abſolute Power,</hi> as it is a new Term, ſo thoſe who have coined it, may make it ſignifie what they will. The <hi>Roman Law</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>Princeps Legibus ſolutus,</hi> and <hi>Abſolute</hi> in its natural ſignification, importing the being without all Ties and Reſtraints; then the true meaning of this ſeems to be, that there is an <hi>Inherent Power</hi> in the <hi>King,</hi> which can neither be reſtrained by <hi>Laws, Promiſes,</hi> nor <hi>Oaths;</hi> for nothing leſs than the being <hi>free</hi> from all theſe renders a <hi>Power Abſolute.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. If the former Term ſeemed to ſtretch our Allegiance, that which comes after it, is yet a ſtep of another nature, tho' one can hardly imagine what can go beyond <hi>Abſolute Power;</hi> and it is in theſe Words, <hi>Which all our Subjects
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:101251:10"/> are to obey without reſerve.</hi> And this is the carrying Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience many ſizes beyond what the <hi>Grand Seigneur</hi> has ever yet claimed: For all <hi>Princes,</hi> even the moſt violent Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to <hi>Abſolute Power,</hi> till <hi>Lewis the Great</hi>'s Time, have thought it enough to oblige their <hi>Subjects</hi> to ſubmit to their <hi>Power,</hi> and to bear whatſoever they thought good to impoſe upon them; but till the Days of the late <hi>Converſions</hi> by <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons,</hi> it was never ſo much as pretended, that <hi>Subjects</hi> were bound <hi>to obey <hi>their Prince</hi> without Reſerve,</hi> and to be of his <hi>Religion</hi> becauſe he would have it ſo. Which was the only Argument that thoſe late <hi>Apoſtles</hi> made uſe of; ſo it is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble this Qualification of the Duty of <hi>Subjects</hi> was put in here, to prepare us for a terrible <hi>le Roy le veut;</hi> and in that caſe we are told here, that we muſt <hi>obey without reſerve;</hi> and when thoſe ſevere Orders come, the <hi>Privy-Council,</hi> and all ſuch as execute this <hi>Proclamation,</hi> will be bound by this <hi>Declaration</hi> to ſhew themſelves more forward than any others, <hi>to obey without reſerve:</hi> and thoſe poor Pretenſions of <hi>Conſcience, Religion, Honour,</hi> and <hi>Reaſon,</hi> will be then reckoned as <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves <hi>upon their Obedience,</hi>
               </hi> which are all now ſhut out.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Theſe being the Grounds upon which this <hi>Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi> is founded, we ought not only to conſider what Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences are now drawn from them, but what may be drawn from them at any time hereafter: for if they are of force to juſtifie that which is now inferred from them, it will be full as juſt to draw from the ſame Premiſes an Aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> of the Rights of the <hi>Subjects,</hi> not only to <hi>Church-lands,</hi> but to all <hi>Property</hi> whatſoever. In a word, it aſſerts a <hi>Power</hi> to be in the <hi>King,</hi> to command what he will; and an Obligation in the <hi>Subjects,</hi> to <hi>obey</hi> whatſoever he ſhall <hi>command.</hi>

               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:101251:11"/> have ſet before our Eyes very freſh Inſtances of the <hi>Charity</hi> of that <hi>Religion:</hi> While thoſe Examples are ſo green, it is a little too impoſing on us, to talk to us of <hi>Chriſtian Love and Charity.</hi> No doubt his <hi>Majeſty</hi> means ſincerely, and his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſs to all his <hi>Promiſes,</hi> chiefly to thoſe made ſince he came to the <hi>Crown,</hi> will not ſuffer us to think an unbecoming Thought of his Royal Intentions; but yet after all, tho' it ſeems by this <hi>Proclamation,</hi> that we are bound to <hi>obey without Reſerve,</hi> it is Hardſhip upon Hardſhip to be bound to <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve without Reſerve.</hi>

There are a ſort of People here tolerated, that will be very hardly found out: and theſe are the <hi>Moderate Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians.</hi> Now, as ſome ſay, that there are very few of thoſe People in <hi>Scotland,</hi> that deſerve this Character, ſo it is hard to tell what it amounts to; and the calling any of them <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate,</hi> cuts off all their ſhare in this Grace. <hi>Moderation</hi> is a Quality that lies in the Mind; and how this will be found out, I cannot ſo readily gueſs. If a Standard had been given of Opinions or Practices, then one could have known how this might have been diſtinguiſhed; but as it lies, it will not be eaſie to make the Diſcrimination; and the decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them all <hi>Immoderate,</hi> ſhuts them out quite.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. Another Foundation laid down for Repealing all <hi>Laws</hi> made againſt the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> is, That they were enacted in <hi>King James the Sixth</hi>'s Minority; with ſome harſh Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that are not to be inſiſted on, ſince they ſhew more the Heat of the Penner, than the Dignity of the Prince, in whoſe Name they are given out; but all theſe <hi>Laws</hi> were ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified over and over again by <hi>King James,</hi> when he came to be of full Age: and they have received many Confirmations by <hi>King Charles the Firſt,</hi> and <hi>King Charles the Second,</hi> as well as by his <hi>preſent Majeſty,</hi> both when he repreſented his <hi>Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> in the Year 1681. and ſince <hi>He</hi> himſelf came to the <hi>Crown,</hi> ſo that whatſoever may be ſaid concerning the firſt Formation of thoſe <hi>Laws,</hi> they have received now for the courſe of a whole hundred <hi>Years,</hi> that are lapſed ſince <hi>King James</hi> was of full Age, ſo many Confirmations, that if there is any thing certain in Humane Government, we might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon them; but this new coined <hi>Abſolute Power</hi> muſt carry all before it.</p>
            <pb n="13" facs="tcp:101251:11"/>
            <p n="7">VII. It is alſo well known, that the whole Settlement of the <hi>Church-Lands</hi> and <hi>Tythes,</hi> with many other things, and more particularly the Eſtabliſhment of the <hi>Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> was likewiſe enacted in <hi>King James</hi>'s Minority, as well as thoſe <hi>Penal Laws:</hi> ſo that the Reaſon now made uſe of to annul the <hi>Penal Laws,</hi> will ſerve full as well for another Act of this <hi>Abſolute Power,</hi> that ſhall aboliſh all thoſe; and if Maxims that unhinge all the Securities of Humane Society, and all that is ſacred in Government, ought to be look'd on with the juſteſt and deepeſt Prejudices poſſible, one is tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to loſe the Reſpect that is due to every thing that carries a Royal Stamp upon it, when he ſees ſuch Grounds made uſe of, as muſt ſhake all Settlements whatſoever: For if a Preſcription of 120 <hi>Years,</hi> and Confirmations reiterated over and over again theſe 100 <hi>Years</hi> paſt, do not purge ſome De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects in the firſt Formation of thoſe <hi>Laws,</hi> what can make us ſecure? But this looks ſo like a Fetch of the <hi>French Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative Law,</hi> both in their Proceſſes with relation to the <hi>Edict of Nantes,</hi> and thoſe concerning <hi>Dependences</hi> at <hi>Mets,</hi> that this ſeems to be a Copy from that famous Original.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. It were too much ill Nature to look into the Hiſtory of the laſt Age, to examine on what Grounds thoſe Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters of <hi>Pious</hi> and <hi>Bleſſed,</hi> given to the <hi>Memory</hi> of <hi>Q. Mary,</hi> are built; but ſince <hi>King James</hi>'s <hi>Memory</hi> has the Character of <hi>Glorious</hi> given to it, if the Civility due to the <hi>Fair Sex</hi> makes one unwilling to look into the one, yet the other may be a little dwelt on. The peculiar <hi>Glory</hi> that belongs to <hi>King James</hi>'s <hi>Memory,</hi> is, that he was a Prince of great Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and that he employed it chiefly in writing for <hi>Religion:</hi> Of the <hi>Volume</hi> in <hi>Folio,</hi> in which we have his <hi>Works,</hi> two thirds are againſt the <hi>Church of Rome;</hi> one part of them is a Commentary on the <hi>Revelation,</hi> proving that the <hi>Pope is Antichrist;</hi> another part of them belonged more naturally to his Poſt and Dignity; which is the Warning that he gave to all the Princes and States of <hi>Europe,</hi> againſt the Treaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and Bloody Doctrines of the <hi>Papacy.</hi> The firſt Act he did when he came of Age, was to ſwear in Perſon with all his Family, and afterwards with all his People of <hi>Scotland,</hi> a <hi>Covenant,</hi> containing an Enumeration of all the <hi>Points</hi> of <hi>Popery,</hi> and a moſt ſolemn Renunciation of them, ſomewhat
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:101251:12"/> like our <hi>Parliament Teſt.</hi> His <hi>firſt Speech</hi> to the <hi>Parliament of England,</hi> was Copious on the ſame Subject; and he left a <hi>Legacy</hi> of a <hi>Wiſh</hi> on ſuch of his <hi>Poſterity</hi> as ſhould go over to that <hi>Religion,</hi> which in good manners is ſuppreſſed. It is known, <hi>King James</hi> was no <hi>Conqueror,</hi> and that he made more uſe of his <hi>Pen</hi> than his <hi>Sword:</hi> ſo the <hi>Glory</hi> that is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to his <hi>Memory</hi> muſt fall chiefly on his Learned and Immortal Writings: and ſince there is ſuch a Veneration ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed for him, it agrees not ill with this to wiſh, that his <hi>Works</hi> were more ſtudied by thoſe who offer ſuch Incenſe to his <hi>Glorious <hi>Memory.</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">IX. His <hi>Majeſty</hi> aſſures his People of <hi>Scotland,</hi> upon his <hi>certain Knowledge,</hi> and <hi>long Experience,</hi> that the <hi>Catholicks,</hi> as they are <hi>good Chriſtians, ſo they are likewiſe dutiful Subjects:</hi> But if we muſt believe both theſe equally, then we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude ſeverely againſt their being <hi>good Chriſtians;</hi> for we are ſure they can never be <hi>good Subjects,</hi> not only to a <hi>Heretical Prince,</hi> but even to a <hi>Catholick Prince,</hi> if he does not <hi>extirpate Hereticks;</hi> for their beloved <hi>Council of the Lateran,</hi> that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> has likewiſe decreed, <hi>That if a Prince does not extirpate Hereticks out of his Dominions, the Pope muſt depoſe him, and declare his Subjects abſolved from their Allegiance, and give his Dominions to another.</hi> So that even his <hi>Majeſty,</hi> how much ſoever he may be a Zealous <hi>Catholick,</hi> yet cannot be aſſured of their Fidelity to him, unleſs he has given them ſecret Aſſurances, that he is reſolved to <hi>extirpate Hereticks out of his Dominions;</hi> and that all the Promiſes which he now makes to theſe poor Wretches, are no other way to be kept, than the Aſſurances which the <hi>Great Lewis</hi> gave to his <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Subjects,</hi> of his obſerving ſtill the <hi>Edict of Nantes,</hi> even after he had reſolved to break it; and alſo his laſt Promiſe made in the <hi>Edict</hi> that repealed the <hi>Edict of Nantes,</hi> by which he gave Aſſurances, that no Violence ſhould be uſed to any for their <hi>Religion,</hi> in the very time that he was ordering all poſſible Violences to be put in execution againſt them.</p>
            <p n="10">X. His <hi>Majeſty</hi> aſſures us, that on all occaſions the <hi>Papiſts</hi> have ſhewed themſelves <hi>good and faithful Subjects to him and his Royal Predeceſſors;</hi> but how <hi>Abſolute</hi> ſoever the King's <hi>Power</hi> may be, it ſeems his Knowledge of Hiſtory is not ſo <hi>Abſolute,</hi> but it may be capable of ſome Improvement. It
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:101251:12"/> will be hard to find out what <hi>Loyalty</hi> they ſhewed on the <hi>oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion</hi> of the <hi>Gunpowder Plot,</hi> or during the whole Progreſs of the <hi>Rebellion of Ireland;</hi> if the King will either take the Words of <hi>King James</hi> of <hi>Glorious <hi>Memory,</hi>
               </hi> or <hi>King Charles</hi> the Firſt, that was indeed of <hi>Pious <hi>and</hi> Bleſſed <hi>Memory,</hi>
               </hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the Word of the Penners of this <hi>Proclamation,</hi> it will not be hard to find <hi>occaſions</hi> where they were a little wanting in this their ſo much boaſted <hi>Loyalty:</hi> and we are ſure, that by the Principles of that <hi>Religion,</hi> the <hi>King</hi> can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be aſſured of the <hi>Fidelity</hi> of thoſe he calls his <hi>Catholick Subjects,</hi> but by engaging to them to make his <hi>Heretical Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi> Sacrifices to their Rage.</p>
            <p n="11">XI. The <hi>King</hi> declares them capable of all the Offices and <hi>Benefices</hi> which he ſhall think fit to beſtow on them, and only reſtrains them from <hi>invading the Proteſtant Churches by force:</hi> ſo that here a Door is plainly opened for admitting them to the Exerciſe of their <hi>Religion</hi> in <hi>Proteſtant Churches,</hi> ſo they do not break into them by <hi>force;</hi> and whatſoever may be the ſenſe of the Term <hi>Benefice</hi> in its ancient and firſt ſignification, now it ſtands only for <hi>Church Preferments;</hi> ſo that when any <hi>Churches,</hi> that are at the <hi>King's</hi> Gift, fall va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant, here is a plain intimation, that they are to be provided to them: and then it is very probable, that all the <hi>Laws</hi> made againſt ſuch as go not to their <hi>Pariſh-Churches,</hi> will be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely turned upon thoſe that will not come to <hi>Maſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="12">XII. His <hi>Majeſty</hi> does in the next place, in the vertue of his <hi>Abſolute Power,</hi> annul a great many <hi>Laws,</hi> as well thoſe that eſtabliſhed the <hi>Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy,</hi> as the late <hi>Teſt,</hi> enacted by himſelf in Perſon, while he repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Brother: upon which he gave as ſtrange an Eſſay to the World of his <hi>Abſolute Juſtice</hi> in the Attainder of the late Earl of <hi>Argile,</hi> as he does now of his <hi>Abſolute Power</hi> in condemning the <hi>Test</hi> it ſelf; he alſo repeals his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the <hi>Teſt,</hi> ſince he came to the <hi>Crown,</hi> which he offered as the cleareſt Evidence that he could give of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to maintain the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> and by which he gained ſo much upon that <hi>Parliament,</hi> that he obtained every thing from them that he deſired of them, till he came to try them in the Matters of <hi>Religion.</hi> This is no extraordinary Evidence to aſſure his People, that his <hi>Promiſes</hi> will be like
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:101251:13"/> the Laws of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians, which alter not;</hi> nor will the diſgrace of the <hi>Commiſſioner</hi> that enacted that <hi>Law,</hi> lay this Matter wholly on him; for the <hi>Letter</hi> that he brought, the <hi>Speech</hi> that he made, and the <hi>Inſtructions</hi> which he got, are all too well known, to be ſo ſoon forgotten; and if <hi>Princes</hi> will give their <hi>Subjects</hi> reaſon to think, that they forget their <hi>Promiſes,</hi> as ſoon as the Turn is ſerved for which they were made, this will be too prevailing a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation to the <hi>Subjects</hi> to mind the Princes <hi>Promiſe</hi> as little as it ſeems he himſelf does; and will force them to conclude, that the <hi>Truth</hi> of the Prince is not ſo <hi>Abſolute</hi> as it ſeems he fancies his <hi>Power</hi> to be.</p>
            <p n="13">XIII. Here is not only a Repealing of a great many <hi>Laws,</hi> and eſtabliſhed <hi>Oaths</hi> and <hi>Teſts;</hi> but by the exerciſe of the <hi>Abſolute Power,</hi> a new <hi>Oath</hi> is impoſed, which was never pretended to by the <hi>Crown</hi> in any former time; and as the <hi>Oath</hi> is created by this <hi>Abſolute Power,</hi> ſo it ſeems the <hi>Abſolute Power</hi> muſt be ſupported by this <hi>Oath:</hi> ſince one Branch of it is an Obligation to <hi>maintain his Majeſty and his lawful Succeſſors in the exerciſe of this their <hi>Abſolute Power</hi> and Authority, againſt all Deadly,</hi> which I ſuppoſe is <hi>Scotch</hi> for <hi>Mortals.</hi> Now to impoſe ſo hard a Yoke as this <hi>Abſolute Power</hi> on the <hi>Subjects,</hi> ſeems no ſmall ſtretch; but it is a wonderful <hi>Exerciſe</hi> of it, to oblige the <hi>Subjects</hi> to <hi>defend</hi> this: it had been more modeſt, if they had been only bound to bear it, and ſubmit to it: but it is a terrible thing ſo far to extinguiſh all the Remnants of Natural Liberty, or of a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Government, as to oblige the <hi>Subjects</hi> by <hi>Oath</hi> to <hi>main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Exerciſe of this,</hi> which plainly muſt deſtroy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: For the ſhort Execution by the Bow-ſtrings of <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key,</hi> or by ſending <hi>Orders</hi> to Men to return in their Heads, being an <hi>Exerciſe of this <hi>Abſolute Power,</hi>
               </hi> it is a little hard to make Men ſwear to <hi>maintain the King in it:</hi> and if that <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> has ſuffered ſo much by the many <hi>Oaths</hi> that have been in uſe among them, as is marked in this <hi>Proclamation,</hi> I am afraid this new <hi>Oath</hi> will not much mend the matter.</p>
            <p n="14">XIV. Yet after all, there is ſome Comfort; his Majeſty aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures them, he will uſe no <hi>Violence</hi> nor <hi>Force,</hi> nor any <hi>Invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible Neceſſity <hi>to any Man upon the account of his Perſuaſion.</hi>
               </hi> It were too great a want of Reſpect to fancy, that a time may
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:101251:13"/> come in which even this may be remembred, full as well, as the <hi>Promiſes</hi> that were made to the <hi>Parliament</hi> after His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty came to the <hi>Crown.</hi> I do not, I confeſs, apprehend that; for I ſee here to great a Caution uſed in the choice of theſe Words, that it is plain, very great Severities may very well conſiſt with them. It is clear, that the general Words of <hi>Violence</hi> and <hi>Force,</hi> are to be determined by theſe laſt of <hi>Invincible Neceſſity;</hi> ſo that the <hi>King</hi> does only <hi>promiſe</hi> to lay no <hi>Invincible Neceſſity</hi> on his <hi>Subjects;</hi> but for all <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities</hi> that are not <hi>Invincible,</hi> it ſeems they muſt expect to bear a large ſhare of them; Diſgraces, want of Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Fines, and Impriſonments, and even Death it ſelf, are all <hi>Vincible</hi> things to a Man of firmneſs of Mind; ſo that the <hi>Violences of Torture,</hi> the <hi>Furies of Dragoons,</hi> and ſome of the <hi>Methods</hi> now practiſed in <hi>France,</hi> perhaps may be inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded within this <hi>Promiſe;</hi> ſince theſe ſeem almoſt <hi>Invincible</hi> to Humane Nature, if it is not fortified with an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary meaſure of Grace: but as to all other things, His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty binds himſelf up from no part of <hi>the Exerciſe of his <hi>Abſolute Power</hi>
               </hi> by this Promiſe.</p>
            <p n="15">XV. His <hi>Majeſty</hi> orders this to go immediately to the <hi>Great Seal,</hi> without paſſing thro' the other <hi>Seals:</hi> Now ſince this is counter-ſigned by the <hi>Secretary,</hi> in whoſe Hands the <hi>Signet</hi> is, there was no other ſtep to be made but thro' the <hi>Privy Seal;</hi> ſo I muſt own, I have a great curioſity of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Character in whoſe Hands the <hi>Privy Seal</hi> is at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; for it ſeems his Conſcience is not ſo very ſupple, as the <hi>Chancellor</hi>'s and the <hi>Secretaries</hi> are; but it is very likely, if he does not quickly change his Mind, the <hi>Privy Seal</hi> at leaſt will very quickly change its <hi>Keeper;</hi> and I am ſorry to hear, that the <hi>Lord Chancellor</hi> and the <hi>Secretary</hi> have not another Brother to fill this Poſt, that ſo the Guilt of the Ruine of that <hi>Nation</hi> may lie on one ſingle <hi>Family,</hi> and that there may be no others involved in it.</p>
            <p n="16">XVI. Upon the whole matter, many ſmaller things being waved, it being extream unpleaſant to find fault, where one has all poſſible diſpoſitions to pay all Reſpect; we here in <hi>England</hi> ſee what we muſt look for. A <hi>Parliament</hi> in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> was tried, but it proved a little ſtubborn; and now <hi>Abſolute Power</hi> comes to ſet all right; ſo when the <hi>Cloſetting</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:101251:14"/> has gone round, ſo that <hi>Noſes</hi> are counted, we may perhaps ſee a <hi>Parliament</hi> here; but if it chances to be untoward, and not to <hi>obey without Reſerve,</hi> then our Reverend <hi>Judges</hi> will copy from <hi>Scotland,</hi> and will not only tell us of the King's <hi>Imperial Power,</hi> but will diſcover to us this new Myſtery of <hi>Abſolute Power, <hi>to which we are all bound</hi> to obey without Reſerve.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theſe <hi>Reflections</hi> refer in ſo many Places to <hi>ſome Words</hi> in the <hi>Proclamation,</hi> that it was thought neceſſary to ſet them near one another, that the <hi>Reader</hi> may be able to judge, whether he is deceived by any falſe <hi>Quotations,</hi> or not.</hi>

            <head>A LETTER Containing ſome REFLECTIONS On His MAJESTY's DECLARATION FOR LIBERTY of CONSCIENCE. Dated the Fourth of <hi>April,</hi> 1687.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p n="1">I. I Thank you for the Favour of ſending me the late <hi>Declaration</hi> that His <hi>Majeſty</hi> has granted for <hi>Liberty of Conſcience.</hi> I confeſs, I longed for it with great Impatience, and was ſurpriſed to find it ſo diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from the <hi>Scotch</hi> Pattern; for I imagined, that it was to be ſet to the Second Part of the ſame Tune: nor can I ſee why the Penners of this have ſunk ſo much in their Style; for I ſuppoſe the ſame Men penned both. I expected to have ſeen the Imperial Language of <hi>Abſolute Power, to which all the Subjects are to obey without Reſerve; and of the caſſing, annulling, the ſtopping, and diſabling of Laws</hi> ſet forth in the Preamble and Body of this <hi>Declaration;</hi> whereas thoſe dreadful Words are not to be found here: for in ſtead of <hi>repealing the Laws,</hi> His <hi>Majeſty</hi> pretends by this only to <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpend them;</hi> and tho' in effect this amounts to a <hi>Repeal,</hi> yet
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:101251:18"/> it muſt be confeſſed that the Words are ſofter. Now ſince the <hi>Abſolute Power,</hi> to which His <hi>Majeſty</hi> pretends in <hi>Scotland,</hi> is not founded on ſuch poor things as <hi>Law;</hi> for that would look as if it were the Gift of the <hi>People;</hi> but on the Divine Authority, which is ſuppoſed to be delegated to His <hi>Majeſty,</hi> this may be as well claimed in <hi>England,</hi> as it was in <hi>Scotland:</hi> and the pretenſion to <hi>Abſolute Power</hi> is ſo great a thing, that ſince His <hi>Majeſty</hi> thought fit once to claim it, he is little beholden to thoſe that make him fall ſo much in his Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage; eſpecially ſince both theſe <hi>Declarations</hi> have appeared in our <hi>Gazettes;</hi> ſo that as we ſee what is done in <hi>Scotland,</hi> we know from hence what is in ſome Peoples Hearts, and what we may expect in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. His <hi>Majeſty</hi> tells his People, that <hi>the perfect Enjoyment of their Property has never been in any Caſe invaded by him ſince his coming to the Crown.</hi> This is indeed matter of great Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to all good <hi>Subjects;</hi> for it lets them ſee, that ſuch Invaſions as have been made on <hi>Property,</hi> have been done without His <hi>Majeſty</hi>'s knowledge: ſo that no doubt the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing to levy the <hi>Cuſtoms</hi> and the <hi>Additional Exciſe</hi> (which had been granted only during the late <hi>King</hi>'s Life) before the <hi>Parliament</hi> could meet to renew the Grant, was done without His <hi>Majeſty</hi>'s knowledge; the many Violences com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted not only by <hi>Soldiers,</hi> but <hi>Officers,</hi> in all the <hi>Parts</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> which are ſevere Invaſions on <hi>Property,</hi> have been all without his <hi>Majeſty</hi>'s knowledge; and ſince the firſt Branch of <hi>Property</hi> is the Right that a Man has to his <hi>Life,</hi> the ſtrange Eſſay of <hi>Mahometan Government</hi> that was ſhewed at <hi>Taunton;</hi> and the no leſs ſtrange Proceedings of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <hi>Lord Chancellor,</hi> in his <hi>Circuit</hi> after the <hi>Rebellion,</hi> (which are very juſtly called <hi>His Campagne,</hi> for it was an open Act of Hoſtility to all <hi>Law</hi>) and for which, and other Services of the like nature, it is believed he has had the Reward of the <hi>Great Seal,</hi> and the <hi>Executions</hi> of thoſe who have left their <hi>Colours,</hi> which being founded on no <hi>Law,</hi> are no other than ſo many <hi>Murders;</hi> all theſe, I ſay, are as we are ſure, Invaſions on <hi>Property:</hi> But ſince the <hi>King</hi> tells us, that no ſuch <hi>Invaſions</hi> have been made ſince he came to the <hi>Crown,</hi> we muſt conclude, that all theſe things have fallen out with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his Privity. And if a Standing <hi>Army,</hi> in time of Peace,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:101251:18"/> has been ever look'd on by this <hi>Nation</hi> as an Attempt upon the whole <hi>Property</hi> of the <hi>Nation</hi> in groſs, one muſt conclude, that even this is done without His <hi>Majeſty</hi>'s knowledge.</p>
            <p n="3">III. His <hi>Majeſty</hi> expreſſes his Charity for us in a kind Wiſh, <hi>That we were all Members of the Catholick Church:</hi> In return to which, we offer up daily our moſt earneſt Prayers for him, That he may become a Member of the <hi>truly Catholick Church;</hi> for Wiſhes and Prayers do no hurt on no ſide: But His <hi>Majeſty</hi> adds, That <hi>it has ever been his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that Conſcience ought not to be conſtrained, nor People forced in Matters of meer Religion.</hi> We are very happy, if this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues to be always his Senſe; but we are ſure in this he is no obedient <hi>Member</hi> of that which he means by the <hi>Catholick Church:</hi> for it has over and over again decreed the <hi>Extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Hereticks:</hi> It encourages <hi>Princes</hi> to it, by the Offer of the Pardon of their Sins; it threatens them to it, by denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing to them not only the Judgments of God, but that which is more ſenſible, the loſs of their <hi>Dominions:</hi> and it ſeems they intend to make us know that part of their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, even before we come to feel it, ſince tho' ſome of that Communion would take away the Horror which the Fourth <hi>Council</hi> of the <hi>Lateran</hi> gives us, in which theſe things were decreed, by denying it to be a <hi>General Council,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting the Authority of thoſe <hi>Canons;</hi> yea the moſt learned of all the <hi>Apoſtates</hi> that has fallen to them from our <hi>Church,</hi> has ſo lately given up this Plea, and has ſo formally acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the Authority of that <hi>Council,</hi> and of its <hi>Canons,</hi> that it ſeems they think they are bound to this piece of fair dealing, of warning us before hand of our Danger. It is true, <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſays, <hi>The Church does not always execute her Power of Depoſing Heretical Princes, tho' ſhe always retains it:</hi> one Reaſon that he aſſigns, is, <hi>Becauſe ſhe is not at all times able to put it in execution:</hi> ſo the ſame Reaſon may perhaps make it appear unadviſable to <hi>extirpate Hereticks,</hi> becauſe that at preſent it connot be done; but the <hi>Right</hi> remains en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, and is put in execution in ſuch an unrelenting manner in all Places where that <hi>Religion</hi> prevails, that it has a very ill Grace, to ſee any <hi>Member</hi> of that <hi>Church</hi> ſpeak in this ſtrain: and when neither the <hi>Policy</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> nor the Greatneſs of their <hi>Monarch,</hi> nor yet the Intereſts of the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour</hi>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:101251:19"/> joined to the Gentleneſs of his own Temper, could withſtand theſe Bloody Councils, that are indeed parts of that <hi>Religion,</hi> we can ſee no Reaſon to induce us to believe, that a <hi>Toleration of Religion</hi> is propoſed with any other De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, but either to divide us, or to lay us aſleep, till it is time to give the Alarm for deſtroying us.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. If all the <hi>Endeavours that have been uſed in the laſt four Reigns, for bringing the Subjects of this Kingdom to a Unity in Religion, have been ineffectual,</hi> as His <hi>Majeſty</hi> ſays, we know to whom we owe both the firſt Beginnings and the Progreſs of the Diviſions among our ſelves: the Gentleneſs of <hi>Queen Elizabeth's</hi> Government, and the numbers of thoſe that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered to the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> made it ſcarce poſſible to put an end to that Party during her Reign, which has been ever ſince reſtleſs, and has had credit enough at <hi>Court</hi> during the three laſt <hi>Reigns,</hi> not only to ſupport it ſelf, but to diſtract us, and to divert us from apprehending the danger of being ſwallowed up by them, by ſomenting our own Differences, and by ſetting on either a <hi>Toleration,</hi> or a <hi>Perſecution,</hi> as it has hapned to ſerve their <hi>Intereſts.</hi> It is not ſo very long ſince, that nothing was to be heard at <hi>Court</hi> but the ſupporting the <hi>Church of England,</hi> and the extirpating all the <hi>Nonconformiſts;</hi> and it were eaſie to name the Perſons, if it were decent, that had this ever in their Mouths: but now all is turned round again, the <hi>Church of England</hi> is in diſgrace; and now the Encouragement of <hi>Trade,</hi> the Quiet of the <hi>Nation,</hi> and the Freedom of <hi>Conſcience</hi> are again in vogue, that were ſuch odious things but a few years ago, that the very mentioning of them was enough to load any Man with Suſpicions, as backward in the <hi>King</hi>'s Service, while ſuch Methods are uſed, and the Government is as in an Ague, divided between hot and cold Fits, no wonder if <hi>Laws</hi> ſo unſteadily executed have failed of their Effect.</p>
            <p n="5">V. There is a good Reſerve here left for <hi>Severity,</hi> when the proper Opportunity to ſet it on preſents it ſelf: for His <hi>Majesty</hi> declares himſelf only againſt the <hi>forcing of Men in Matters of meer Religion:</hi> ſo that whenſoever Religion and Policy come to be ſo interwoven, that <hi>meer Religion</hi> is not the Caſe, and that <hi>Publick Safety</hi> may be pretended, then this <hi>Declaration</hi> is to be no more claimed: ſo that the faſtning
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:101251:19"/> any thing upon the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> that is inconſiſtent with the Publick Peace, will be pretended to ſhew that they are not perſecuted for <hi>meer Religion.</hi> In <hi>France,</hi> when it was reſolved to extirpate the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> all the Diſcourſes that were written on that Subject were full of the <hi>Wars</hi> oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by thoſe of the <hi>Religion</hi> in the laſt Age; tho' as theſe were the happy Occaſions of bringing the Houſe of <hi>Bourbon</hi> to the <hi>Crown,</hi> they had been ended above 80 Years ago, and there had not been ſo much as the leaſt Tumult raiſed by them theſe 50 Years paſt: ſo that the <hi>French,</hi> who have ſmarted under this Severity, could not be charged with the leaſt Infraction of the <hi>Law:</hi> yet Stories of a hundred Years old were raiſed up to inſpire into the <hi>King</hi> thoſe Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of them, which have produced the terrible Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects that are viſible to all the World. There is another <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion</hi> in this <hi>Declaration,</hi> which lets us likewiſe ſee with what caution the Offers of Favour are now worded, that ſo there may be an Occaſion given, when the Time and Conjuncture ſhall be favourable, to break thro' them all: it is in theſe words; <hi>So that they take eſpecial Care, that nothing be preached or taught amongſt them, which may any ways tend to alienate the Hearts of our People from us or our Government.</hi> This in it ſelf is very reaſonable, and could admit of no Exception, if we had not to do with a ſet of <hi>Men,</hi> who to our great Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune have ſo much Credit with his <hi>Majeſty,</hi> and who will be no ſooner lodged in the Power to which they pretend, than they will make every thing that is <hi>preached</hi> againſt <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery</hi> paſs for that which may <hi>in ſome manner alienate the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects from the King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">VI. <hi>His Majeſty makes no doubt of the Concurrence of his two Houſes of Parliament, when he ſhall think it convenient for them to meet.</hi> The Hearts of <hi>Kings</hi> are unſearchable; ſo that it is a little too preſumptuous to look into His <hi>Majeſties</hi> ſecret Thoughts: but according to the Judgments that we would make of other Mens Thoughts by their Actions, one would be tempted to think, that His <hi>Majeſty</hi> made ſome doubt of it, ſince his Affairs both at home and abroad could not go the worſe, if it appeared that there were a perfect Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding between <hi>Him</hi> and His <hi>Parliament,</hi> and that his <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> were ſupporting him with freſh <hi>Supplies;</hi> and this <hi>Houſe
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:101251:20"/> of Commons</hi> is ſo much at his devotion, that all the World ſaw how ready they were to grant every thing that he could deſire of them, till he began to lay off the Maſque with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the <hi>Teſt,</hi> and ſince that time the frequent <hi>Prorogati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> the <hi>Cloſetting,</hi> and the Pains that has been taken to gain <hi>Members,</hi> by Promiſes made to ſome, and the Diſgraces of others, would make one a little inclined to think, that <hi>ſome doubt was made of their Concurrence.</hi> But we muſt confeſs, that the depth of His <hi>Majeſty</hi>'s Judgment is ſuch, that we cannot fathom it, and therefore we cannot gueſs what his Doubts or his Aſſurances are. It is true, the words that come after unriddle the Myſtery a little, which are, <hi>when His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty ſhall think it convenient for them to meet:</hi> for the meaning of this ſeems plain, that His <hi>Majeſty</hi> is reſolved that they ſhall never meet, till he receives ſuch Aſſurances, in a new round of <hi>Cloſetting,</hi> that he ſhall be put out of doubt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. I will not enter into the Diſpute concerning <hi>Liberty of Conſcience,</hi> and the <hi>Reaſons</hi> that may be offered for it to a <hi>Seſſion</hi> of <hi>Parliament:</hi> for there is ſcarce any one Point, that either with relation to <hi>Religion,</hi> or <hi>Politicks,</hi> affords a greater variety of Matter for Reflection: and I make no doubt to ſay, that there is abundance of Reaſon to oblige a <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> to review all the <hi>Penal Laws,</hi> either with relation to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts,</hi> or to <hi>Diſſenters:</hi> but I will take the boldneſs to add one thing, that the <hi>King's ſuſpending of Laws</hi> ſtrikes at the root of this whole <hi>Government,</hi> and ſubverts it quite: for if there is any thing certain with relation to the <hi>Engliſh Government,</hi> it is this, <hi>that the Executive Power of the Law is entirely in the King;</hi> and the <hi>Law</hi> to fortifie him in the Management of it, has clothed him with a vaſt <hi>Prerogative,</hi> and made it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful upon any Pretence whatſoever to reſiſt him: whereas on the other Hand, the <hi>Legiſlative Power</hi> is not ſo entirely in the <hi>King,</hi> but that the <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> have ſuch a ſhare in it, that no <hi>Law</hi> can be either <hi>made, repealed,</hi> or, which is all one, <hi>ſuſpended,</hi> but by their Conſent: ſo that the placing this <hi>Legiſlative Power</hi> ſingly in the <hi>King,</hi> is a Subverſion of this whole <hi>Government;</hi> ſince the Eſſence of all Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments conſiſts in the Subjects of the Legiſlative Authority; Acts of Violence or Injuſtice, committed in the <hi>Executive</hi>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:101251:20"/> part, are ſuch things that all <hi>Princes</hi> being ſubject to them, the Peace of Mankind were very ill ſecured, if it were not unlawful to reſiſt upon any Pretence taken from any ill Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations, in which as the <hi>Law</hi> may be doubtful, ſo the Facts may be uncertain, and at worſt the Publick Peace muſt always be more valued, than any private Oppreſſions or Injuries whatſoever. But the total <hi>Subverſion</hi> of a <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> being ſo contrary to the <hi>Truſt</hi> that is given to the <hi>Prince</hi> who ought to execute it, will put Men upon uneaſie and dangerous Inquiries; which will turn little to the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of thoſe who are driving Matters to ſuch a doubtful and deſperate Iſſue.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. If there is any thing in which the Exerciſe of the <hi>Legiſlative Power</hi> ſeems Indiſpenſible, it is in thoſe <hi>Oaths of Allegiance</hi> and <hi>Teſts</hi> that are thought neceſſary to qualifie Men either to be admitted to enjoy the Protection of the <hi>Law,</hi> or to bear a Share in the <hi>Government;</hi> for in theſe the Security of the Government is chiefly concerned; and therefore the total extinction of theſe, as it is not only a Suſpenſion of them, but a plain Repealing of them, ſo it is a <hi>Subverting</hi> of the whole Foundation of our <hi>Government:</hi> For the Regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament</hi> had ſet, both for the Subjects having the Protection of the State by the <hi>Oath of Allegiance,</hi> and for a ſhare in Places of Truſt by the <hi>Teſts,</hi> is now pluckt up by the Roots, when it is declared, <hi>That theſe ſhall not at any time hereafter be required to be taken or ſubſcribed by any Perſons whatſoever:</hi> for it is plain, that this is no <hi>Suſpenſion</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> but a formal <hi>Repeal</hi> of it, in as plain Words as can be conceived.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. His <hi>Majeſty</hi> ſays, that <hi>the Benefit of the Service of all his Subjects, is by the Law of Nature inſeparably annexed to, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent in his Sacred Perſon.</hi> It is ſomewhat ſtrange, that when ſo many <hi>Laws,</hi> that we all know are ſuſpended, the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> which is ſo hard to be found out, ſhould be cited; but the Penners of this <hi>Declaration</hi> had beſt let <hi>that Law</hi> lie forgotten among the reſt; for there is a ſcurvy Paragraph in it, concerning <hi>Self-preſervation,</hi> that is capable of very unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable Gloſſes. It is hard to tell what Section of the <hi>Law of Nature</hi> has mark'd out either ſuch <hi>a Form of Government,</hi> or ſuch <hi>a Family</hi> for it. And if his <hi>Majeſty</hi> renounces his
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:101251:21"/> Pretenſions to our <hi>Allegiance</hi> as founded on the <hi>Laws of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and betakes himſelf to this <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> he will perhaps find the Counſel was a little too raſh: But to make the moſt of this that can be, the <hi>Law of Nations</hi> or <hi>Nature</hi> does indeed allow the <hi>Governours</hi> of all Societies a Power to ſerve themſelves of every Member of it in the caſes of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream Danger; but no <hi>Law of Nature</hi> that has been yet heard of, will conclude, that if by <hi>ſpecial Laws</hi> a ſort of Men have been diſabled from all Imployments, that a <hi>Prince</hi> who at his Coronation <hi>ſwore</hi> to maintain thoſe <hi>Laws,</hi> may at his pleaſure extinguiſh all theſe Diſabilities.</p>
            <p n="10">X. At the end of the <hi>Declaration,</hi> as in a Poſtſcript, His <hi>Majeſty</hi> aſſures his Subjects, that he will <hi>maintain them in their Properties, as well in Church and Abby-Lands, as other Lands:</hi> But the Chief of all their <hi>Properties</hi> being the ſhare that they have by their <hi>Repreſentatives</hi> in the <hi>Legiſlative Power;</hi> this <hi>Declaration</hi> which breaks thro' that, is no great Evidence that the reſt will be maintained: And to ſpeak plainly, when a <hi>Coronation Oath</hi> is ſo little remembred, other <hi>Promiſes</hi> muſt have a proportioned degree of Credit given to them: As for the <hi>Abbey-Lands,</hi> the keeping them from the <hi>Church,</hi> is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Principles of that Religion, <hi>Sacriledge;</hi> and that is a <hi>Mortal Sin,</hi> and there can no <hi>Abſolution</hi> be given to any who continue in it: And ſo this <hi>Promiſe</hi> being an Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to maintain men in a <hi>Mortal-Sin,</hi> is null and void of it is ſelf: <hi>Church-Lands</hi> are alſo according to the Doctrine of their <hi>Canoniſts,</hi> ſo immediately <hi>Gods Right,</hi> that the <hi>Pope</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is only the Adminiſtrator and Diſpenſer, but is not the Maſter of them; he can indeed make a truck for God, or let them ſo <hi>low,</hi> that God ſhall be an eaſie <hi>Landlord,</hi> but he cannot alter God's <hi>Property,</hi> nor tranſlate the Right that is in him to <hi>Sacrilegious Laymen</hi> and <hi>Hereticks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="11">XI. One of the Effects of this <hi>Declaration,</hi> will be the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on foot a new run of <hi>Addreſſes</hi> over the <hi>Nation:</hi> For there is nothing how impudent and baſe ſoever, of which the abject Flattery of a ſlaviſh Spirit is not capable. It muſt be confeſt, to the Reproach of the Age, that all thoſe ſtrains of Flattery among the <hi>Romans,</hi> that <hi>Tacitus</hi> ſets forth with ſo much juſt Scorn, are modeſt things, compared to what this <hi>Nation</hi> has produced within theſe <hi>ſeven Years;</hi> only if our
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:101251:21"/> Flattery has come ſhort of the Refinedneſs of the <hi>Romans,</hi> it has exceeded theirs as much in its loathed Fulſomneſs. The late <hi>King</hi> ſet out a <hi>Declaration,</hi> in which he gave the moſt ſolemn Aſſurances poſſible of his adhering to the <hi>Church of England,</hi> and to the <hi>Religion eſtabliſhed by Law,</hi> and of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to have frequent <hi>Parliaments;</hi> upon which the whole <hi>Nation</hi> fell, as it were, into Raptures of Joy and Flattery: But tho' he lived four Years after that, he called no <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> notwithſtanding the <hi>Law</hi> for <hi>Triennial Parliaments,</hi> and the manner of his <hi>Death,</hi> and the <hi>Papers</hi> printed after his Death in his Name, have ſufficiently ſhewed, that he was equally ſincere in both thoſe Aſſurances that he gave, as well in that relating to <hi>Religion,</hi> as in that other relating to fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent <hi>Parliaments;</hi> yet upon his <hi>Death</hi> a new ſet of <hi>Addreſſes</hi> appeared, in which all that Flattery could invent, was brought forth, in the Commendations of a <hi>Prince,</hi> to whoſe <hi>Memory</hi> the greateſt kindneſs can be done, is <hi>to forget him.</hi> And becauſe his preſent <hi>Majeſty</hi> upon his coming to the <hi>Throne,</hi> gave ſome very general <hi>Promiſe</hi> of <hi>Maintaining the Church of England,</hi> this was magnified in ſo extravagant a ſtrain, as if it had been a ſecurity greater than any that the <hi>Law</hi> could give; tho' by the regard that the <hi>King</hi> has both to <hi>it,</hi> and to the <hi>Laws,</hi> it appears that he is reſolved to maintain both equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Since then the <hi>Nation</hi> has already made it ſelf ſufficiently ridiculous both to the preſent, and to all ſucceeding Ages, it is time that at laſt men ſhould grow weary, and become a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed of their Folly.</p>
            <p n="12">XII. The <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> are now invited to ſet an Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to the reſt; and they who have valued themſelves hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to upon their Oppoſition to <hi>Popery,</hi> and that have quarrelled with the <hi>Church of England,</hi> for ſome ſmall Approaches to it, in a few <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> are now ſollicited to rejoyce, becauſe the <hi>Laws</hi> that ſecure us againſt it, are all plucked up; ſince they enjoy at <hi>preſent</hi> and <hi>during pleaſure,</hi> leave to meet together. It is natural for all men to love to be ſet at eaſe, eſpecially in the matters of their Conſciences; but it is viſible, that thoſe who allow them this favour, do it with no other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, but that under a pretence of a <hi>General Toleration,</hi> they may introduce a <hi>Religion</hi> which muſt <hi>perſecute</hi> all equally: It is likewiſe apparent how much <hi>they</hi> are <hi>hated,</hi> and how much
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:101251:22"/> 
               <hi>they</hi> have been <hi>perſecuted</hi> by the Inſtigation of thoſe who now court them, and who have now no Game that is more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing, than the engaging <hi>them</hi> and the <hi>Church of England</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to new Quarrels: And as for the <hi>Promiſes</hi> now made to them, it cannot be ſuppoſed that they will be more laſting than thoſe that were made ſome time ago to the <hi>Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> who had both a better Title in <hi>Law,</hi> and greater Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit upon the <hi>Crown</hi> to aſſure them that they ſhould be well uſed, than theſe can pretend to. The <hi>Nation</hi> has ſcarce for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given ſome of the <hi>Church of England</hi> the <hi>Perſecution</hi> into which they have ſuffered themſelves to be couſened; tho' now that they ſee <hi>Popery</hi> barefac'd, the Stand that they have made, and the vigorous oppoſition that they have given to it, is that which makes all men willing to forget what is paſt, and raiſes again the Glory of a <hi>Church</hi> that was not a little ſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Indiſcretion and Weakneſs of thoſe that were too apt to believe and hope, and ſo ſuffered themſelves to be made a <hi>Property</hi> to thoſe who would now make them a <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</hi> The Sufferings of the <hi>Nonconformiſts,</hi> and the Fury that the <hi>Popiſh Party</hi> expreſſed againſt them, had recommended them ſo much to the Compaſſions of the <hi>Nation,</hi> and had given them ſo juſt a Pretenſion to favour in a better time, that it will look like a Curſe of God upon them, if a few <hi>men,</hi> whom the Court has gained to betray them, can have ſuch an ill Influence upon them as to make them throw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all that Merit, and thoſe Compaſſions which their Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings have procured them; and to go and court <hi>thoſe</hi> who are only ſeemingly kind to them, that they may deſtroy both <hi>them</hi> and <hi>us.</hi> They muſt remember, that as the <hi>Church of England</hi> is the only Eſtabliſhment that our <hi>Religion</hi> has by <hi>Law,</hi> ſo it is the main body of the <hi>Nation,</hi> and all the <hi>Sects</hi> are but ſmall and ſtragling Parties: and if the legal Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Church</hi> is diſſolved, and that Body is once broken, theſe leſſer Bodies will be all at mercy; and it is an eaſie thing to define what the Mercies of the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> are.</p>
            <p n="13">XIII. But tho' it muſt be confeſſed, that the <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> are ſtill under ſome Temptations to receive every thing that gives them preſent eaſe, with a little too much kindneſs, ſince they lie expoſed to many ſevere <hi>Laws,</hi> of which they have of late felt the weight very heavily; and as they are
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:101251:22"/> men, and ſome of them as ill-natured men as other People, ſo it is no wonder, if upon the firſt Surpriſes of the <hi>Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> they are a little delighted to ſee the <hi>Church of England,</hi> after all its Services and Submiſſions to the <hi>Court,</hi> ſo much mortified by it; ſo that taking all together, it will not be ſtrange if they commit ſome Follies upon this occaſion. Yet on the other hand, it paſſes all imagination, to ſee ſome of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> eſpecially thoſe whoſe Natures we know are ſo particularly ſharpned in the point of <hi>Perſecution,</hi> chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when it is levelled againſt the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> rejoyce at this <hi>Declaration,</hi> and make <hi>Addreſſes</hi> upon it. It is hard to think that they have attained to ſo high a pitch of Chriſtian Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as to thank thoſe who do now <hi>deſpitefully uſe them,</hi> and that as an earneſt that within a little while they will <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute</hi> them. This will be an Original, and a Maſter-piece in Flattery, which muſt needs draw the laſt degrees of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt on, ſuch as are capable of ſo abject and ſordid a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance, and that not only from all the true <hi>Members</hi> of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> but likewiſe from thoſe of the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> it ſelf; for every man is apt to eſteem an Enemy that is brave even in his Misfortunes, as much as he deſpiſes thoſe whoſe minds ſink with their Condition. For what is it that theſe men would thank the <hi>King?</hi> Is it becauſe he breaks thoſe <hi>Laws</hi> that are made in their favour, and for their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, and is now ſtriking at the Root of all the legal Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement that they have for their <hi>Religion?</hi> Or is it becauſe that at the ſame time that the <hi>King</hi> profeſſes a <hi>Religion</hi> that condemns his <hi>Supremacy,</hi> yet he is not contented with the Exerciſe of it as it is warranted by <hi>Law,</hi> but carries it ſo far as to erect a <hi>Court</hi> contrary to the expreſs words of a <hi>Law</hi> that was ſo lately made? That <hi>Court</hi> takes care to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a due proportion between their <hi>Conſtitution</hi> and all their <hi>Proceedings,</hi> that ſo all may be of a piece, and all equally contrary to <hi>Law.</hi> They have ſuſpended one <hi>Biſhop</hi> only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he would not do that which was not in his power to do; for ſince there is no Extrajudiciary Authority in <hi>England,</hi> a <hi>Biſhop</hi> can no more proceed to a Sentence of Suſpenſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a <hi>Clergy man</hi> without a Trial, and the hearing of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, than a <hi>Judge</hi> can give a Sentence in his Chamber with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an Indictment, a Trial, or a Jury; and becauſe one of
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:101251:23"/> the <hi>Greateſt Bodies</hi> of <hi>England</hi> would not break their <hi>Oaths,</hi> and obey a <hi>Mandate</hi> that plainly contradicted them, we ſee to what a pitch this is like to be carried. I will not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate upon this <hi>illegal Court,</hi> to tell what Judgments are coming, but without carrying our Jealouſies too far, one may ſafely conclude, that they will never depart ſo far from their firſt <hi>Institution,</hi> as to have any regard, either to our <hi>Religion,</hi> or our <hi>Laws,</hi> or <hi>Liberties,</hi> in any thing they do. If all this were acted by avowed <hi>Papiſts,</hi> as we are ſure it is projected by ſuch, there were nothing extraordinary in it: but that which carries our Indignation a little too far to be eaſily governed, is to ſee ſome <hi>pretended Proteſtants,</hi> and a few <hi>Biſhops,</hi> among thoſe that are the fatal <hi>Inſtruments</hi> of pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling down the <hi>Church of England;</hi> and that thoſe <hi>Mercenaries</hi> ſacrifice their <hi>Religion</hi> and their <hi>Church</hi> to their Ambition and Intereſts: this has ſuch peculiar Characters of Misfortune upon it, that it ſeems it is not enough if we periſh without Pity, ſince we fall by that hand that we have ſo much ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported and fortified, but we muſt become the Scorn of all the World, ſince we have produced ſuch an unnatural <hi>Brood,</hi> that even while they are pretending to be the <hi>Sons</hi> of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> are cutting their <hi>Mother</hi>'s Throat; and not content with <hi>Judas</hi>'s Crime, of ſaying, <hi>Hail Maſter,</hi> and <hi>kiſſing</hi> him, while they are betraying him into the hands of others, theſe carry their Wickedneſs further, and ſay, <hi>Hail, Mother,</hi> and then they themſelves <hi>Murther</hi> her. If after all this we were called on to bear this as <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it as <hi>Subjects;</hi> if we were required in Patience to poſſeſs our own Souls, and to be in Charity with our Enemies, and which is more, to forgive our <hi>Falſe-Brethren,</hi> who add Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery to their Hatred: The Exhortation were ſeaſonable, and indeed a little neceſſary; for human Nature cannot eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly take down things of ſuch a hard digeſtion; but to tell us that <hi>We</hi> muſt make <hi>Addreſſes,</hi> and offer <hi>Thanks</hi> for all this, is to inſult a little too much upon us in our Sufferings: And he that can believe that a dry and cautiouſly worded <hi>Promiſe</hi> of maintaining the <hi>Church of England,</hi> will be religiouſly obſerved, after all that we have ſeen, and is upon that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried ſo far out of his Wits, as to <hi>Addreſs</hi> and give <hi>Thanks,</hi> and will believe ſtill, ſuch a man has nothing to excuſe
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:101251:23"/> him from believing <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> it ſelf; for it is plain that he can bring himſelf to believe even when the thing is contrary to the cleareſt Evidence that his Senſes can give him.</p>

            <p>I Cannot hold asking you, how much <hi>Money</hi> you had from the <hi>Writer</hi> of the <hi>Paper</hi> which you pretend to <hi>Anſwer?</hi> For as you have the Character of a Man that deals with both Hands, ſo this is writ in ſuch a manner, as to make one think you were hired to it by the Adverſe Party: But it has been indeed ſo ordinary to your Friends, to write in this manner of late, that the Cenſures upon it are divided, both fall heavy: Some ſuſpect their Sincerity, others accuſe them for want of a right Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding: For tho' all are not of the pitch of the <hi>Iriſh Prieſts</hi> Reflections on the Biſhop of <hi>Bath and Wells</hi> his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, which was indeed <hi>Iriſh</hi> double refined; yet both in your Books of Controverſie, and Policy, and even in your
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:101251:24"/> 
               <hi>Poems,</hi> you ſeem to have entred into ſuch an Intermixture with the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> that the Thred all over is <hi>Linſie-woolſie.</hi> You acknowledge, that the Gentleman whom you anſwer has a <hi>Polite Pen,</hi> and that his <hi>Letter is an ingenious Paper, and made up of well-compoſed Sentences and Periods:</hi> Yet I believe he will hardly return you your Complement. If <hi>it</hi> was well writ, your Party wants either Men or Judgment extremely, in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing you this Province of anſwering it. If the <hi>Paper</hi> did you ſome hurt, you had better have let the Town be a little pleaſed with it for a while, and have hoped that a little Time, or ſome new Paper, (tho' one of its force is ſcarce to be expected) ſhould have worn it out, than to give it a new Luſtre by ſuch an <hi>Anſwer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Time of the Diſſenters Sufferings,</hi> which you lengthen out to <hi>Twenty ſeven Years,</hi> will hardly amount to <hi>Seven.</hi> For the long Intervals it had, in the laſt <hi>Reign,</hi> are not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got: and thoſe who animated the lateſt and ſevereſt of their Sufferings are ſueh, that in good manners you ought not to reflect on <hi>their</hi> Conduct. <hi>Opium</hi> is as certain a <hi>Poyſon,</hi> tho' not ſo <hi>violent,</hi> as <hi>Sublimate;</hi> and if more <hi>corroſive Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines</hi> did not work, the <hi>Deſign</hi> is the ſame, when <hi>ſoporiferous</hi> ones are uſed; ſince the Patient is to be killed both ways, and it ſeems that all that is in debate, is, which is the ſafer: The accepting a preſent Eaſe, when the ill intent with which it is offered is viſible, is juſt as wiſe an Action, as to take <hi>Opium</hi> to lay a ſmall Diſtemper, when one may conclude from the <hi>Doſe,</hi> that he will never come out of the Sleep. So that after all, it is plain on which ſide the <hi>Madneſs</hi> lies. The <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> for a little preſent eaſe, to be enjoyed at mercy, muſt concur to break down all our Hedges, and to lay us open to that devouring <hi>Power,</hi> before which nothing can ſtand that will not <hi>worſhip</hi> it.</p>
            <p>All that for which you reproach the <hi>Church of England,</hi> amounts to this, that a few good Words could not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade her to deſtroy her ſelf, and to ſacrifice her <hi>Religion</hi> and the <hi>Laws</hi> to a Party that never has done, nor ever can do the <hi>King</hi> half the Service that She has rendred him. There are ſome ſorts of Propoſitions that a Man does not know how to anſwer; nor would he be thought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful, who after he had received ſome Civilities from a
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:101251:25"/> Perſon to whom he had done great Service, could not be prevailed with by theſe ſo far, as to ſpare him his Wife or his Daughter. It muſt argue a peculiar degree of Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, to ask things that are above the being either ask'd or granted. Our <hi>Religion</hi> and our <hi>Government</hi> are Matters that are not to be parted with to ſhew our good Breeding; and of all Men living, you ought not to pretend to <hi>Good Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> who talk as you do, of the <hi>Oppreſſion</hi> of the laſt <hi>Reign.</hi> When the <hi>King</hi>'s Obligations to his <hi>Brother,</hi> and the ſhare that he had in his <hi>Councils,</hi> are conſidered, the reproaching his <hi>Government</hi> has ſo ill a grace, that you are as indecent in your Flatteries, as injurious in your Reflections. And by this Gratitude of yours to the Memory of the late <hi>King,</hi> the <hi>Church of England</hi> may eaſily infer, how long all her Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices would be remembred, even if ſhe had done all that was deſired of her.</p>
            <p>I would fain know which of the <hi>Brethren of the Diſſenters in Foreign Countries ſought their Relief from Rebellion.</hi> The <hi>Germans</hi> Reformed by the Authority of their <hi>Princes,</hi> ſo did the <hi>Swedes,</hi> the <hi>Danes,</hi> and likewiſe the <hi>Switzers.</hi> In <hi>France</hi> they maintained the Princes of the <hi>Blood</hi> againſt the <hi>League;</hi> and in <hi>Holland</hi> the Quarrel was for <hi>Civil Liberties,</hi> Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and Papiſt concurring equally in it. You mention <hi>Holland</hi> as an Inſtance that <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Infallibility</hi> can dwell together; <hi>ſince Papists there ſhew that they can be friendly Neighbours to thoſe whom they think in the wrong.</hi> It is very like they would be ſtill ſo in <hi>England,</hi> if they were under the Laſh of the Law, and ſo were upon their Good-beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, the Government being ſtill againſt them: And this has ſo good an effect in <hi>Holland,</hi> that I hope we ſhall never depart from the <hi>Dutch</hi> Pattern. Some can be very Humble Servants, that would prove Imperious Maſters. You ſay, that <hi>Force</hi> is our only Supporter: but tho' there is no Force of our Side at preſent, it does not appear, that we are in ſuch a tottering condition, as if we had no <hi>Supporter</hi> left us. <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> are of our ſide; and the indiſcreet uſe of <hi>Force,</hi> when ſet on by our Enemies, has rather undermined than ſupported us. But you have taken pains to make us grow wiſer, and to let us ſee our Errors, which is perhaps the only Obligation that we owe you; and we are ſo ſenſible of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:101251:25"/> it, that without examining what your Intentions may have been in it, we heartily thank you for it.</p>
            <p>I do not comprehend what your Quarrel is at the <hi>ſquint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Term</hi> of the <hi>next Heir,</hi> as you call it; tho' I do not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that <hi>ſquinting</hi> comes in your mind whenſoever you think of HER; for all People look <hi>aſquint</hi> at that which troubles them: and <hi>Her</hi> being the <hi>next Heir,</hi> is no leſs the <hi>Delight</hi> of all Good Men, than it is your <hi>Affliction:</hi> All the pains that you take to repreſent <hi>Her</hi> dreadful to the <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters,</hi> muſt needs find that credit with them, that is due to the Inſinuations of an Enemy. It is very true, that as <hi>She</hi> was bred up in our <hi>Church,</hi> She adheres to it ſo eminently, as to make <hi>Her</hi> to be now our <hi>chief Ornament,</hi> as we hope She will be once our <hi>main Defence.</hi> If by <hi>the ſtricteſt Form of our Church,</hi> you mean an <hi>Exemplary Piety,</hi> and a <hi>ſhining Converſation,</hi> you have given Her true <hi>Character:</hi> But your Deſign lies another way, to make the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> form ſtrange Ideas of Her, as if She thought <hi>all Indulgence to them Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal:</hi> But as the Gentleneſs of her Nature is ſuch, that none but thoſe who are ſo guilty, that all Mercy to them would be a Crime, can apprehend any thing that is terrible from <hi>Her;</hi> ſo as for the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> Her going ſo conſtantly to the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Churches, ſhews, that She can very well endure their Aſſemblies, at the ſame time that She prefers ours. <hi>She</hi> has alſo too often expreſſed her diſlike at the heats that have been kept up among us concerning ſuch inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Differences, to paſs for a <hi>Bigot</hi> or <hi>Perſecutor</hi> in ſuch Matters; and <hi>She</hi> ſees both the Miſchief that the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> has received from their Subdiviſions, and the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of granting a <hi>due Liberty of Conſcience,</hi> where She has ſo long lived, that there is no reaſon to make any fanſie that She will either keep up our Differences, or bear down the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> with Rigour. But becauſe you hope for nothing from Her own Inclinations, you would have her terrified with the <hi>ſtrong Argument of Numbers,</hi> which you fanſie will <hi>certainly ſecure them from Her recalling the Favour.</hi> But of what ſide ſoever that Argument may be <hi>ſtrong,</hi> ſure it is not of <hi>theirs</hi> who make but <hi>One to Two hundred;</hi> and I ſuppoſe you ſcarce expect that the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> will rebel, that you may
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:101251:26"/> have your <hi>Maſſes;</hi> and how their Numbers will <hi>ſecure them,</hi> unleſs it be by enabling them to <hi>Rebel,</hi> I cannot imagine: This is indeed a <hi>ſquinting</hi> at the <hi>Next Heir</hi> with a witneſs, when you would already muſter up the Troops that muſt riſe againſt <hi>Her.</hi> But let me tell you, that you know both <hi>Her</hi> Character and the <hi>Princes</hi> very ill, that fanſie they are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be wrought on by <hi>Fear. They</hi> are known, to your great grief, to be above that; and it muſt be to their own merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Inclinations, that you muſt owe all that you can expect under them; but neither to their <hi>Fear,</hi> nor to your own <hi>Numbers.</hi> As for the <hi>Hatred and Contempt, even to the degree of being more ridiculous than the Maſs, under which you ſay Her way of Worſhip is in Holland;</hi> this is one of thoſe Figures of Speech that ſhew how exactly you have ſtudied the <hi>Jeſuits Morals.</hi> All that come from <hi>Holland,</hi> aſſure us, that She is ſo univerſally beloved and eſteemed there, that every thing that ſhe does, is the better thought of even becauſe <hi>She</hi> does it. Upon the whole matter, all that you ſay of the <hi>Next Heir,</hi> proves too truly that you are that for which you reproach the <hi>Church of England,</hi> a Diſciple of the Crown only <hi>for the Loaves;</hi> for if you had that reſpect which you pretend for the <hi>King,</hi> you would have ſhewed it more upon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion.</p>
            <p>Nor am I ſo much in love with your Style, as to imitate it; therefore I will not do you ſo great a pleaſure, as to ſay the leaſt thing that may reflect on that <hi>Authority,</hi> which the <hi>Church of England</hi> has taught me to <hi>reverence,</hi> even after all the <hi>Diſgraces</hi> that She has received from it: and if She were not inſuperably reſtrained by Her Principles, in ſtead of the <hi>Thin Muſter</hi> with which you reproach <hi>Her, She</hi> could ſoon make ſo <hi>Thick</hi> a one, as would make the <hi>Thinneſs</hi> of yours very viſible, upon ſo unequal a Diviſion of the Nation: But She will neither be threatned nor laughed out of Her <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> and Her <hi>Loyalty;</hi> tho' ſuch Inſultings as She meets with, that almoſt paſs all Humane Patience, would tempt Men that had a leſs fixed Principle of Submiſſion, to make their Enemies feel to their coſt, that they owe all the Triumphs they make, more to <hi>our Principles,</hi> than to their own <hi>Force.</hi> Their laughing at <hi>our</hi> Doctrine of <hi>Non reſiſtance,</hi> lets us ſee,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:101251:26"/> that it would be none of <hi>theirs</hi> under the <hi>Next Heir,</hi> at whom you <hi>ſquint,</hi> if the <hi>ſtrong Argument of Numbers</hi> made you not apprehend, that <hi>Two hundred to One</hi> would prove an Unequal Match.</p>
            <p>As for your <hi>Memorandums,</hi> I ſhall anſwer them as ſhort as you give them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It will be hard to perſuade People, that a Deciſion in favour of the <hi>Diſpenſing Power,</hi> flowing from <hi>Judges</hi> that are both <hi>made,</hi> and <hi>paid,</hi> and that may be <hi>removed</hi> at <hi>pleaſure,</hi> will amount to the <hi>recognizing of that Right by Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. It will be hard to perſwade the World, that the <hi>King</hi>'s adhering to his <hi>Promiſes,</hi> and his <hi>Coronation-Oath,</hi> and to the known <hi>Laws</hi> of the Land, would make him <hi>Felo de ſe.</hi> The following of different Methods were the likelier way to it, if it were not for the <hi>Loyalty of the Church of England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. It will be very eaſie to ſee the Uſe of continuing the <hi>Teſt</hi> by <hi>Law;</hi> ſince all thoſe that break thro' it, as well as the <hi>Judges</hi> who have authorized their Crimes, are ſtill liable for all they do: and after all your <hi>huffing,</hi> with the <hi>Diſpenſing Power,</hi> we do not doubt but the apprehenſion of an after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reckoning ſticks <hi>deep</hi> ſomewhere. You ſay, <hi>It may be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that the averſion of a Proteſtant King to the Popiſh Party, will ſufficiently exclude them, even without the Teſt:</hi> But it muſt be confeſſed, that you take all poſſible care to confirm that <hi>Averſion</hi> ſo far, as to put it beyond an <hi>It may be ſuppoſed.</hi> And it ſeems you underſtand <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Prerogative, as well as the <hi>Judges</hi> did the <hi>King</hi>'s, that fanſie the <hi>Teſt</hi> is againſt it: it is ſo ſutable to the nature of all <hi>Governments,</hi> to take Aſſurances of <hi>thoſe</hi> who are admitted to Places of Truſt, that you do very ill to appeal to an <hi>Impartial Conſideration,</hi> for you are ſure to loſe it there.</p>
            <p>Few <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> will believe you in earneſt, when you ſeem zealous for <hi>Publick Liberty,</hi> or the <hi>Magna Charta;</hi> or that you are ſo very apprehenſive of <hi>Slavery:</hi> And your Friends muſt have very much changed both their Natures and their Principles, if <hi>their Conduct does not give cauſe to renew the like Statutes againſt them,</hi> even tho' they ſhould be repealed in this <hi>Reign,</hi> notwithſtanding all your confidence to the contrary.

            <head>AN ANSWER TO A PAPER Printed with <hi>Allowance,</hi> Entitled, <hi>A New Teſt of the Church of England's Loyalty.</hi>
            </head>
            <p n="1">I. THE Accuſing the <hi>Church of England</hi> of Want of <hi>Loyalty,</hi> or the putting it to a <hi>new Teſt,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo freſh a one, with relation to His <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,</hi> argues a high degree of Confidence in him who undertakes it. <hi>She</hi> knew well what were the Doctrines and Practices of thoſe of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> with relation to <hi>Hereticks;</hi> and yet <hi>She</hi> was ſo true to her <hi>Loyalty,</hi> that <hi>She</hi> ſhut her Eyes on all the Temptations that ſo juſt a fear could raiſe in her: And <hi>She</hi> ſet her ſelf to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port His <hi>Majeſties</hi> Right of <hi>Succeſſion,</hi> with ſo much Zeal, that <hi>She</hi> thereby not only put her ſelf in the power of her Enemies, but <hi>She</hi> has alſo expoſed her ſelf to the Scorn of thoſe who inſult over her in her Misfortune. <hi>She</hi> loſt the Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons even of many of her own Children, who thought that her Zeal for an Intereſt, which was then ſo much decry'd, was a little too ſervent: And all thoſe who judged ſeverely of the Proceedings, thought that the Oppoſition which <hi>She</hi> made to the ſide that then went ſo high, had, more Heat than Decency in it. And indeed all this was ſo very extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, that if <hi>She</hi> was not acted by a Principle of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:101251:28"/> 
               <hi>She</hi> could make no Excuſe for her Conduct. There appeared ſuch peculiar Marks of Affection and Heartineſs at every time that the <hi>Duke</hi> was named, whether in drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Health, or upon graver Occaſions, that it ſeemed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected: And when the late <hi>King</hi> himſelf (whoſe Word they took, that he was a <hi>Protestant</hi>) was ſpoke of but coldly, the very Name of the <hi>Duke</hi> ſet her Children all on fire; this made many conclude, that they were ready to ſacrifice all to him: for indeed their Behaviour was inflamed with ſo much Heat, that the greater part of the <hi>Nation</hi> believed they waited for a fit opportunity to declare themſelves. <hi>Faith in Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was not a more frequent Subject of the <hi>Sermons</hi> of many, than <hi>Loyalty;</hi> and the <hi>Right of the Succeſſion to the Crown,</hi> the Heat that appeared in the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> and the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that was in their <hi>Books</hi> on theſe Subjects, and the Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Strains that were in their <hi>Addreſſes,</hi> were all <hi>Originals;</hi> and made the World conclude, That whatever might be laid to their charge, they ſhould never be accuſed of any want of <hi>Loyalty,</hi> at leaſt in this <hi>King</hi>'s time, while the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of ſo ſignal a Service was ſo freſh. When His <hi>Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty</hi> came to the <hi>Crown,</hi> theſe men did ſo entirely depend on the Promiſe that he made <hi>to maintain the Church of England,</hi> that the doubting of the performance appeared to them the worſt ſort of <hi>Infidelity.</hi> They believed, that in His <hi>Majeſty,</hi> the <hi>Hero,</hi> and the <hi>King,</hi> would be too ſtrong for the <hi>Papiſt;</hi> and when any one told them, <hi>How weak a tie the Faith of a Catholick to Hereticks muſt needs be,</hi> they could not hearken to this with any patience; but looked on his <hi>Majeſties Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe</hi> as a thing ſo Sacred, that they imploy'd their Intereſt to carry all <hi>Elections</hi> of <hi>Parliament-men,</hi> for thoſe that were recommended by the <hi>Court,</hi> with ſo much Vigour, that it laid them open to much Cenſure. In <hi>Parliament</hi> they mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for no <hi>Laws</hi> to ſecure their <hi>Religion,</hi> but aſſuring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that <hi>Honour</hi> was the King's <hi>Idol,</hi> they laid hold on it, and fancied, that a publick reliance on his <hi>Word,</hi> would give them an Intereſt in His <hi>Majeſty,</hi> that was Generous, and more ſutable to the Nobleneſs of a Princely Nature, than any new <hi>Laws</hi> could be; ſo that they acquieſced in it, and gave the <hi>King</hi> a vaſt <hi>Revenue</hi> for life. In the Rebellion that followed, they ſhewed with what Zeal they adhered to His
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:101251:28"/> 
               <hi>Majeſty,</hi> even againſt a Pretender that declared for them. And in the Seſſion of <hi>Parliament,</hi> which came after that, they ſhewed their diſpoſition to aſſiſt the <hi>King</hi> with new <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies,</hi> and were willing to excuſe and indemnifie all that was paſt, only they deſired with all poſſible Modeſty, that the <hi>Laws</hi> which His <hi>Majesty</hi> had both <hi>Promiſed,</hi> and at his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation had <hi>Sworn</hi> to maintain, might be <hi>executed.</hi> Here is their Crime, which has raiſed all this Out cry; they did not move for the Execution of Severe or Penal <hi>Laws,</hi> but were willing to let thoſe ſleep, till it might appear by the behaviour of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> whether they might deſerve that there ſhould be any Mitigation made of them in their Favour. Since that time, our <hi>Church men</hi> have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in mixing their Zeal for their <hi>Religion</hi> againſt <hi>Popery,</hi> with a Zeal for <hi>Loyalty</hi> againſt <hi>Rebellion,</hi> becauſe they think theſe two are very well conſiſtent one with another. It is true, they have generally expreſſed an unwillingneſs to part with the <hi>two Teſts,</hi> becauſe they have no mind to truſt the keeping of their Throats to thoſe who they believe will cut them: And they have ſeen nothing in the Conduct of the <hi>Papists,</hi> either within or without the Kingdom, to make them grow weary of the <hi>Laws</hi> for their ſakes; and the ſame Principle of common Senſe, which makes it ſo hard for them to believe <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> makes them conclude, That the <hi>Author</hi> of this Paper, and his <hi>Friends,</hi> are no other, than what they <hi>hear</hi> and <hi>ſee,</hi> and <hi>know</hi> them to be.</p>
            <p n="2">II. One Inſtance in which the <hi>Church of England</hi> ſhewed her Submiſſion to the <hi>Court,</hi> was, that as ſoon as the <hi>Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts</hi> had drawn a new Storm upon themſelves, by their medling in the matter of the <hi>Excluſion,</hi> many of her zealous <hi>Members</hi> went into that Proſecution of them, which the <hi>Court</hi> ſet on foot, with more Heat than was perhaps either juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable in it ſelf, or reaſonable in thoſe Circumſtances; but how cenſurable ſoever ſome angry men may be, it is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſtrange to ſee thoſe of the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> blame us for it, which has decreed ſuch unrelenting Severities againſt all that differ from her, and has enacted that not only in <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments,</hi> but even in <hi>General Councils.</hi> It muſt needs ſound odly to hear the Sons of a <hi>Church</hi> that muſt deſtroy all <hi>others</hi> as ſoon as it can compaſs it, yet complain of the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:101251:29"/> Exceſſes of <hi>Fines</hi> and <hi>Impriſonments,</hi> that have been of late among us. But if this Reproach ſeems a little ſtrange when it is in the Mouth of a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> it is yet much more provok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when it comes from any of the <hi>Court.</hi> Were not all the <hi>Orders</hi> for the late <hi>Severity</hi> ſent from thence? Did not the <hi>Judges</hi> in every <hi>Circuit,</hi> and the Favourite <hi>Juſtices of Peace</hi> in every Seſſions, imploy all their Eloquence on this <hi>Subject?</hi> The Directions that were given to the <hi>Juſtices</hi> and the <hi>Grand Juries,</hi> were all repeated Aggravations of this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and a little <hi>Ordinary Lawyer,</hi> without any other viſible Merit, but an outragious Fury in thoſe Matters, on which he has chiefly valued himſelf, was of a ſudden taken into His <hi>Majeſties</hi> ſpecial Favour, and raiſed up to the <hi>Higheſt Poſts</hi> of the <hi>Law.</hi> All theſe things led ſome of our Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>Clergy</hi> to look on it as a piece of their Duty to the <hi>King</hi> to encourage that <hi>Severity,</hi> of which the <hi>Court</hi> ſeemed ſo fond, that almoſt all People thought they had ſet it up for a Maxim, from which they would never depart. I will not pretend to excuſe all that has been done of late years, but it is certain, that the moſt crying <hi>Severities</hi> have been acted by Perſons that were raiſed up to be <hi>Judges</hi> and <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> for that very end; they were <hi>Inſtructed, Truſted,</hi> and <hi>Reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> for it, both in the <hi>laſt,</hi> and under the <hi>preſent</hi> Reign. <hi>Church Preferments</hi> were diſtributed rather as Recompences of this devouring Zeal, than of a real Merit; and men of more moderate Tempers were not only ill lookt at, but ill uſed. So that it is in it ſelf very unreaſonable to throw the load of the late Rigour on the <hi>Church of England,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſtinction; but it is worſe than in good manners it is fit to call it, if this Reproach comes from the <hi>Court.</hi> And it is ſomewhat unbecoming to ſee that which was ſet on at one time, diſowned at another, while yet he that was the <hi>Chief Inſtrument</hi> in it, is ſtill in ſo high a <hi>Poſt,</hi> and begins now to treat the <hi>Men</hi> of the <hi>Church of England</hi> with the ſame <hi>Brutal Exceſſes</hi> that he beſtowed ſo lately, and ſo li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berally on the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> as if his Deſign were to render him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf equally odious to all Mankind.</p>
            <p n="3">III. The <hi>Church of England</hi> may juſtly expoſtulate when ſhe is treated as <hi>Seditious,</hi> after ſhe has rendred the higheſt Services to the <hi>Civil Authority,</hi> that any <hi>Church</hi> now on Earth
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:101251:29"/> has done: She has beaten down all the Principles of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,</hi> with more Force and Learning, than any Body of men has ever yet done; and has run the hazard of enra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging her Enemies, and loſing her Friends, even for thoſe, from whom the more Learned of her Members knew well what they might expect. And ſince our <hi>Author</hi> likes the figure of a <hi>Snake in ones Boſome</hi> ſo well, I could tell him, that according to the <hi>Apologue,</hi> we took up, and ſheltered an <hi>Intereſt</hi> that was almoſt dead, and by that warmth gave it life; which yet now with the <hi>Snake in the Boſome,</hi> is like to bite us to death. We do not ſay, we are the <hi>only Church that has Principles of Loyalty;</hi> but this we may ſay, That we are the <hi>Church</hi> in the World that carries them the <hi>higheſt;</hi> as we know a <hi>Church</hi> that of all others ſinks them them the <hi>loweſt.</hi> We do not pretend, that we are <hi>Inerrable</hi> in this Point, but acknowledge that ſome of our <hi>Clergy</hi> miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carried in it upon <hi>King Edward</hi>'s Death: Yet at the ſame time others of our Communion adhered more ſteadily to their <hi>Loyalty</hi> in favour of <hi>Queen Mary,</hi> than <hi>She</hi> did to the <hi>Promiſes</hi> that ſhe made to <hi>them.</hi> Upon this Subject our <hi>Author,</hi> by his falſe Quotation of <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> forces me to ſet the <hi>Reader</hi> right, which if it proves to the diſadvantage of his Cauſe, his Friends may thank him for it. I will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into ſo tedious a Digreſſion, as the juſtifying <hi>Queen Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi>'s being Legitimate, and the throwing the <hi>Baſtardy</hi> on <hi>Queen Mary,</hi> muſt carry me to; this I will only ſay, That it was made out, that according to the beſt ſort of <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> uſed by the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> I mean the conſtant Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of all Ages, <hi>King Henry the</hi> VIII. marrying with <hi>Queen Katherine,</hi> was <hi>Inceſtuous,</hi> and by Conſequence <hi>Queen Mary</hi> was the <hi>Baſtard,</hi> and <hi>Queen Elizabeth</hi> was the <hi>Legitimate Iſſue.</hi> But our <hi>Author,</hi> not ſatisfied with defaming <hi>Queen Elizabeth,</hi> tells us, that the <hi>Church of England</hi> was no ſooner ſet up by her, <hi>than She Enacted thoſe Bloody Cannibal Laws to Hang, Draw, and Quarter the Prieſts of the living God.</hi> But ſince theſe <hi>Laws</hi> diſturb him ſo much, What does he think of the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>Burning the poor Servants of the living God,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they cannot give <hi>Divine Worſhip</hi> to that which they believe to be only a <hi>Piece of Bread?</hi> The Repreſentation he gives of this part of our Hiſtory, is ſo falſe, that tho' upon
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:101251:30"/> 
               <hi>Queen Elizabeth</hi>'s coming to the <hi>Crown,</hi> there were many Complaints exhibited of the illegal Violences that <hi>Bonner</hi> and other Butchers had committed; yet all theſe were ſtifled, and no <hi>Penal Laws</hi> were enacted againſt thoſe of that <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi> The <hi>Popiſh Clergy</hi> were indeed turned out, but they were well uſed, and had Penſions aſſigned them; ſo ready was the <hi>Queen</hi> and our <hi>Church</hi> to forgive what was paſt, and to ſhew all Gentleneſs for the future. During the firſt thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years of her <hi>Reign,</hi> matters went on calmly, without any ſort of Severity on the account of <hi>Religion.</hi> But then the reſtleſs Spirit of that Party began to throw the Nation into violent Convulſions. The <hi>Pope</hi> depoſed the <hi>Queen,</hi> and and one of the Party had the Impudence to poſt up the <hi>Bull</hi> in <hi>London;</hi> upon this followed ſeveral <hi>Rebellions;</hi> both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the <hi>Papists</hi> of both <hi>Kingdoms</hi> entred into Confederacies with the <hi>King of Spain</hi> and the <hi>Court of Rome:</hi> The <hi>Prieſts</hi> diſpoſed all the <hi>People</hi> that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on them, to ſubmit to the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Authority in that <hi>Depoſition,</hi> and to reject the <hi>Queen</hi>'s. Theſe Endeavours, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides open Rebellions, produced many ſecret Practices a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her Life. All theſe things gave the riſe to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere <hi>Laws,</hi> which began not to be enacted before the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth year of her <hi>Reign.</hi> A War was formed by the <hi>Bull of Depoſition,</hi> between the <hi>Queen</hi> and the <hi>Court of Rome,</hi> ſo it was a neceſſary piece of Precaution to declare all thoſe to be Traitors, who were the <hi>Miſſionaries</hi> of that Authority which had ſtript the <hi>Queen</hi> of hers: Yet thoſe <hi>Laws</hi> were not executed upon ſome Secular <hi>Prieſts</hi> who had the Hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty to condemn the <hi>Depoſing Doctrine.</hi> As for the <hi>Unhappy Death</hi> of the <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> it was brought on by the wicked Practices of her own <hi>Party,</hi> who fatally involved her in ſome of them: <hi>She</hi> was but a <hi>Subject</hi> here in <hi>England,</hi> and if the <hi>Queen</hi> took a more violent way than was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent for her own Security; here was no <hi>Diſloyalty</hi> nor <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion</hi> in the <hi>Church of England,</hi> which owed her no ſort of <hi>Allegiance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">IV. I do not pretend that the <hi>Church of England</hi> has any great cauſe to value her ſelf upon her Fidelity to <hi>King Charles the First,</hi> tho' our <hi>Author</hi> would have it paſs <hi>for the only thing of which She can boaſt;</hi> for I confeſs, <hi>the cauſe
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:101251:30"/> of the Church</hi> was ſo twiſted with the <hi>King's,</hi> that Intereſt and Duty went together; tho' I will not go ſo far as our <hi>Author,</hi> who ſays, <hi>that the Law of Nature dictates to every Individual to fight in his own Defence:</hi> This is too bold a thing to be delivered ſo crudely at this time. The <hi>Laws of Nature</hi> are perpetual, and can never be cancelled by any ſpecial Law: So if theſe <hi>Gentlemen</hi> own ſo freely, that this is a <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> they had beſt take care not to provoke <hi>Nature</hi> too much, leſt She fly to the Relief that this <hi>Law</hi> may give her, unleſs ſhe is reſtrained by the <hi>Loyalty</hi> of our <hi>Church.</hi> Our <hi>Author</hi> values his <hi>Party</hi> much upon their <hi>Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty</hi> to <hi>King Charles the Firſt:</hi> But I muſt take the liberty to ask him, of what <hi>Religion</hi> were the <hi>Iriſh Rebels?</hi> and what ſort of <hi>Loyalty</hi> was it, that they ſhewed, either in the firſt <hi>Maſſacre,</hi> or in the Progreſs of that <hi>Rebellion?</hi> Their <hi>Meſſages</hi> to the <hi>Pope,</hi> to the <hi>Court of France,</hi> and to the <hi>Duke of Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain,</hi> offering themſelves to any of theſe that would have undertaken to protect them, are Acts of <hi>Loyalty,</hi> which the <hi>Church of England</hi> is no way inclined to follow, and the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentical Proofs of theſe things are ready to be produced. Nor need I add to this, the hard terms they offered to the <hi>King,</hi> and their ill uſage of thoſe whom he imployed. I could likewiſe repreſs the Inſolence of this <hi>Writer,</hi> by telling him of the ſlaviſh Submiſſions that <hi>their Party</hi> made to <hi>Cromwel,</hi> both <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Son.</hi> As for their adhering to <hi>King Charles the Firſt,</hi> there is a peculiar boldneſs in our <hi>Author</hi>'s Aſſertion, who ſays, That they had <hi>no Hope nor Intereſt in that cauſe:</hi> The State of that <hi>Court</hi> is not ſo quite forgot, but that we do well remember what Credit the <hi>Queen</hi> had with the <hi>King,</hi> and what Hopes <hi>She</hi> gave the <hi>Party;</hi> yet they did not ſo entirely eſpouſe the <hi>King's cauſe,</hi> but that they had likewiſe a flying Squadron in the <hi>Parliaments Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi> how boldly ſoever this may be denied by our <hi>Author;</hi> for this I will give him a Proof that is beyond exception, in a <hi>Declaration</hi> of that <hi>Kings,</hi> ſent to the <hi>Kingdom of Scotland,</hi> bearing date the 21 of <hi>April</hi> 1643. which is printed over and over again; and as an <hi>Author</hi> that writes the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of the <hi>late Wars,</hi> has aſſured us, the clean draught of it, corrected in ſome places with the <hi>King</hi>'s own Hand, is yet extant; ſo that it cannot be pretended, that this was only a bold Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:101251:31"/> of ſome of the <hi>Kings Miniſters</hi> that might be ill af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to their Party. In that <hi>Declaration</hi> the <hi>King</hi> ſtudied to poſſeſs his <hi>Subjects</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> with the Juſtice of his Cauſe, and among other things, to clear himſelf of that Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that he had an <hi>Army of Papiſts</hi> about him; after many things ſaid on that head, theſe words are added; <hi>Great numbers of that Religion have been with great Alacrity enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in that Rebellious Army againſt us; and others have been ſeduced, to whom we had formerly denied Imployments, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the Examination of many Priſoners, of whom we have taken twenty, and thirty at a time of one Troop or Company, of that Religion.</hi> I hope our <hi>Author</hi> will not have the Impudence to diſpute the Credit that is due to this Teſtimony; but no Diſcoveries, how evident ſo ever they may be, can affect ſome ſort of Men that have a Secret againſt bluſhing.</p>
            <p n="5">V. Our <hi>Author</hi> exhorts us to change <hi>our Principles of Loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and to take example of our Catholick Neighbours, how to behave our ſelves towards a Prince that is not of our Perſwaſion.</hi> But would he have us learn of our <hi>Iriſh Neighbours</hi> to cut our Fellow-ſubjects Throats, and rebel againſt our <hi>King,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is of another <hi>Religion?</hi> For that is the freſheſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample that any of our <hi>Catholick Neighbours</hi> have ſet us; and therefore I do not look ſo far back as to the <hi>Gunpowder-Plot,</hi> or the <hi>League</hi> of <hi>France</hi> in the laſt Age. He reproaches us for <hi>failing in our Fidelity to our King.</hi> But in this matter we appeal to God, Angels, and Men, and in particular to His <hi>Majeſty:</hi> Let our Enemies ſhew any one point of our Duty, in which we have failed; for as we cannot be charged for having preach'd any ſeditious Doctrine, ſo we are not want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the preaching of the <hi>Duties</hi> of <hi>Loyalty,</hi> even when we ſee what they are like to <hi>coſt</hi> us. The Point which he ſingles out, is, <hi>That we have failed in that grateful Return that we owed His Majeſty for his Promiſe of maintaining our</hi> Church <hi>as it is eſtabliſhed by Law; ſince upon that we ought to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed the Sanguinary Laws, and the late impious Teſts; the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer being enacted to maintain the Uſurpation of</hi> Queen Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth, <hi>and the other being contrived to exclude the preſent King.</hi> We have not failed to pay all the Gratitude and Duty that was poſſible, in return to His <hi>Majeſties Promiſe,</hi> which we have carried ſo far, that we are become the Object even of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:101251:31"/> our Enemies Scorn by it. With all Humility be it ſaid, that if His <hi>Majeſty</hi> had promiſed us a farther Degree of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, than that of which the <hi>Law</hi> had aſſured us, it might have been expected, that our return ſhould have been a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Obedience beyond that which was required by <hi>Law;</hi> ſo that the return of the Obedience injoined by <hi>Law,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers a Promiſe of a <hi>Protection</hi> according to <hi>Law:</hi> Yet we carried this matter further; for, as was ſet forth in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this <hi>Paper,</hi> we went on in ſo high a pace of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance and Confidence, that we drew the Cenſures of the whole <hi>Nation</hi> on us: Nor could any Jealouſies or Fears give us the leaſt Apprehenſions, till we were ſo hard preſſed in matters of <hi>Religion,</hi> that we could be no longer ſilent. The ſame <hi>Apoſtle</hi> that taught us to <hi>honour the King,</hi> ſaid like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, that we muſt <hi>obey God rather than man.</hi> Our <hi>Author</hi> knows the Hiſtory of our <hi>Laws</hi> ill; for beſides what has been already ſaid, touching the <hi>Laws</hi> made by Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the ſevereſt of all our <hi>Penal Laws,</hi> and that which troubles him and his Friends moſt, was paſt by <hi>K. James</hi> after the <hi>Gunpowder-Plot;</hi> a Provocation that might have well juſtified even greater Severities. But tho' our <hi>Author</hi> may hope to impoſe on an ignorant <hi>Reader,</hi> who may be apt to believe implicitly what he ſays concerning the <hi>Laws</hi> of the laſt Age, yet it was too bold for him to aſſert, that the <hi>Teſts</hi> which are ſo lately made, were contrived to <hi>exclude</hi> the preſent <hi>King,</hi> when there was not a Thought of <hi>Excluſion</hi> many years after the firſt was made, and the <hi>Duke</hi> was excepted out of the <hi>Second</hi> by a ſpecial <hi>Proviſo.</hi> But theſe <hi>Gentlemen</hi> will do well never to mention the <hi>Excluſion;</hi> for every time that it is named, it will make People call to mind the Service that the <hi>Church of England</hi> did in that matter, and that will car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with it a Reproach of <hi>Ingratitude</hi> that needs not be ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated. He alſo confounds the <hi>two Teſts,</hi> as if that for <hi>Publick Imployments</hi> contained in it a Declaration of the <hi>King's being an Idolater,</hi> or as he makes it, a <hi>Pagan,</hi> which is not at all in it; but in the other for the <hi>Members</hi> of <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> in which there is indeed a Declaration, that the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> is guilty of <hi>Idolatry;</hi> which is done in general terms, without applying it to His <hi>Majeſty,</hi> as our Author does: Upon this he would infer, That his Majeſty is not ſafe till
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:101251:32"/> the <hi>Teſts</hi> are taken away; but we have given ſuch Evidences of our <hi>Loyalty,</hi> that we have plainly ſhewed this to be falſe; ſince we do openly declare, that our <hi>Duty</hi> to the <hi>King</hi> is not founded on his being of this or that <hi>Religion;</hi> ſo that His <hi>Majeſty</hi> has a full Security from our Principles, tho' the <hi>Teſts</hi> continue, ſince there is no reaſon that we who did run the hazard of being ruined by the <hi>Excluders,</hi> when the Tide was ſo ſtrong againſt us, would fail his <hi>Majeſty</hi> now, when our Intereſt and Duty are joyned together: But if the <hi>Teſts</hi> are taken away, it is certain that we can have <hi>no Security any longer;</hi> for we ſhall be then laid open to the Violence of ſuch reſtleſs and ill-natured men, as the <hi>Author</hi> of this <hi>Paper</hi> and his <hi>Brethren</hi> are.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. The ſame reaſon that made <hi>our Saviour</hi> refuſe to throw himſelf down from the Roof of the Temple, when the Devil tempted him to it, in the vain Confidence, that <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels muſt be aſſiſtant to him to preſerve him,</hi> holds good in <hi>our Caſe.</hi> Our Saviour ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt not tempt the Lord thy God.</hi> And we dare not truſt our ſelves to the Faith, and to the Mercies of a <hi>Society,</hi> that is but too well known to the World, to pretend, that we ſhould pull down our Pales to let in ſuch <hi>Wolves</hi> among us. <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>Laws</hi> have given us legal <hi>Security,</hi> and His <hi>Majesty</hi> has promiſed to maintain us in it; and we think it argues no Diſtruſt either of <hi>God,</hi> or the Truth of our <hi>Religion,</hi> to ſay, that we cannot by any Act of our own, lay our ſelves open, and throw away that defence. Nor would we willingly expoſe His <hi>Majeſty</hi> to the <hi>unwearied Sollicitations of a ſort of men,</hi> who, if we may judge of that which is to come, by that which is paſt, would give him no reſt, if once the reſtraints of <hi>Law</hi> were taken off, but would drive matters to thoſe Extremities to which we ſee their Natures carry them head long.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. The laſt <hi>Paragraph</hi> is a ſtrain worthy of that School that bred our <hi>Author;</hi> he ſays, <hi>His Majeſty may withdraw his Royal Protection from the Church of England, which was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed her upon the account of her conſtant Fidelity;</hi> and he brings no other Proof to confirm ſo bold an <hi>Aſſertion,</hi> but a falſe <hi>Axiome</hi> of that deſpiſed <hi>Philoſophy</hi> in which he was bred; <hi>Ceſſante cauſa tollitur effectus.</hi> This is indeed ſuch an Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to His <hi>Majeſty,</hi> that I preſume to ſay it with all humble
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:101251:32"/> reverence, theſe are the laſt perſons whom he ought to <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> that have the boldneſs to touch ſo ſacred a point as <hi>the Faith of a Prince,</hi> which is the chief Security of Government, and the Foundation of all the Confidence that a <hi>Prince</hi> can promiſe himſelf from his <hi>People;</hi> and which, once blaſted, can never be recovered. Equivocations may be both taught and practiſed with leſs danger, by an <hi>Order</hi> that has little Credit to loſe; but nothing can ſhake <hi>Thrones</hi> ſo much as ſuch treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous <hi>Maxims.</hi> I muſt alſo ask our <hi>Author,</hi> in what point of <hi>Fidelity</hi> has our Church <hi>failed</hi> ſo far as to make her forfeit her Title to His <hi>Majeſties Promiſes?</hi> For as he himſelf has ſtated this matter, it comes all to this: <hi>The King promiſed that he would maintain the Church of England as establiſhed by Law.</hi> Upon which in Gratitude he ſays, That the <hi>Church of England</hi> was bound to throw up the Chief <hi>Security</hi> that ſhe had in her Eſtabliſhment <hi>by Law;</hi> which is, that <hi>all</hi> who are intruſted either with the <hi>Legiſlative</hi> or the <hi>Executive</hi> parts of our <hi>Government</hi> muſt be of her <hi>Communion;</hi> and if the <hi>Church of England</hi> is not ſo tame, and ſo ſubmiſſive, as to part with <hi>this,</hi> then the <hi>King</hi> is free from his <hi>Promiſe,</hi> and may withdraw his <hi>Royal Protection,</hi> tho' I muſt crave leave to tell him, that the <hi>Laws</hi> gave the <hi>Church of England</hi> a Right to that <hi>Protection,</hi> whether His <hi>Majeſty</hi> had promiſed it, or not.</p>
            <p>Of all the <hi>Maxims</hi> in the World, there is none more hurtful to the <hi>Government,</hi> in our preſent Circumſtances, than the ſaying, that the <hi>King's Promiſes</hi> and the <hi>Peoples Fidelity</hi> ought to be <hi>reciprocal;</hi> and that a Failure in the one, cuts off the other; for by a very natural Conſequence the <hi>Subject</hi> may likewiſe ſay, That their <hi>Oaths of Allegeance</hi> being founded on the Aſſurance of His <hi>Majeſties Protection,</hi> the <hi>One binds</hi> no longer than the <hi>Other</hi> is <hi>obſerved:</hi> and the Inferences that may be drawn from hence, will be very terrible, if the <hi>Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty</hi> of the ſo much decryed <hi>Church of England</hi> does not put a ſtop to them.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>THE Secretary Hand</hi> is known to all the <hi>Writing Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi> of the Town; but here is an Eſſay of the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary's Stile</hi> for the <hi>Maſters</hi> of our Language: This is an Age of Improvements, and Men that come very young into Imployments, make commonly a great Progreſs; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore common things are not to be expected here: it is true, ſome Roughneſſes in the <hi>Stile</hi> ſeem to intimate, that the Writer could turn his <hi>Conſcience</hi> more eaſily than he can do his Pen, and that the one is a little ſtiffer and leſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliant than the other. He tells the <hi>Addreſſers,</hi> That <hi>His Majeſty is well ſatisfied with their Loyalty contained in their Addreſs, for the which he reſolves to perpetuate the Favour.</hi> It appears that the <hi>Secretary-Stile</hi> and the <hi>Notary-Stile</hi> come nearer one another than was generally believed: <hi>For the which</hi> here, and <hi>infringe the ſame</hi> afterwards, are Beauties borrowed from the <hi>Notary-Stile:</hi> The <hi>foreſaid</hi> is not much courſer. The King's <hi>perpetuating the Favour,</hi> is no eaſie thing, unleſs he could firſt <hi>perpetuate</hi> himſelf. Now tho' His Majeſties Fame will be certainly <hi>immortal,</hi> yet to our great Regret, his Peron is <hi>mortal;</hi> ſo it is hard to conceive how this <hi>Perpetuity</hi> ſhould be ſetled.</p>
               <p>The Method here propoſed is a new Figure of the <hi>Secretary-Stile;</hi> which is the <hi>appointing in the next enſuing Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament the taking off all Penal Laws.</hi> All former <hi>Secretarie</hi> uſed the modeſt Words of <hi>propoſing</hi> or <hi>recommending;</hi> that he who in a former <hi>Eſſay</hi> of this <hi>Stile</hi> told us of His <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>jeſties Abſolute Power, to which all the Subjects are to obey without reſerve,</hi> furniſhes us now with this <hi>new</hi> term of the <hi>King's appointing</hi> what ſhall be done in <hi>Parliament.</hi> But what if after all, the <hi>Parliament</hi> proves ſo ſtubborn, as not to com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ply with this <hi>Appointment,</hi> I am afraid then the <hi>Perpetual</hi> will be of a ſhort continuance. He in the next place men<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tions the <hi>Liberty or Toleration granted by the King. Liberty</hi> is not ſo hard a Word, but that it might be underſtood without this Explanation <hi>or Toleration,</hi> unleſs the <hi>Secretary
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:101251:34"/> Stile</hi> either approaches to the <hi>Notary-Stile</hi> in ſome nauſeous Repetitions, or that he would intimate by this, That all the <hi>Liberty</hi> that is left the Subjects, is comprehended in this <hi>Toleration.</hi> And indeed, after <hi>Abſolute Power</hi> was once aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, is was never fit to name <hi>Liberty</hi> without ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction. After this comes a ſtately Period, <hi>The Enemies to Him, to You, and to this Toleration.</hi> Yet I ſhould be ſorry if it were true; for I hope there are many <hi>Enemies to this Toleration,</hi> who are neither <hi>Enemies</hi> to the <hi>King,</hi> nor to theſe <hi>Addreſſers;</hi> and that on the contrary they are <hi>Enemies</hi> to it, becauſe they are the <hi>beſt Friends</hi> that both the <hi>King,</hi> and the <hi>People</hi> have. It is now no ſecret, that tho' both the <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Princeſs</hi> of <hi>Orange</hi> are great Enemies to <hi>Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and in particular to all Rigour againſt the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> yet they are not ſatisfied with the way in which this <hi>Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is granted. But the reckoning of them as <hi>Enemies</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the <hi>King,</hi> or the <hi>People,</hi> is one of the Figures of this <hi>Stile,</hi> that will hardly paſs; and ſome will not ſtick to ſay, that the Writer of this <hi>Letter</hi> has with this daſh of his Pen, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared more Men <hi>Eemies</hi> to the King, than ever he will be able to make <hi>Friends</hi> to him. He tells them next, that theſe <hi>Enemies</hi> will be <hi>uſing all endeavours to infringe the ſame.</hi> This is alſo a ſtrong Expreſſion. We know the uſe of the <hi>Noun Infractions,</hi> but <hi>Infringe</hi> is borrowed from the <hi>Notaries;</hi> yet the plain ſenſe of this ſeems to be, that thoſe <hi>Enemies</hi> will diſturb the <hi>Meetings,</hi> of which I do not hear any of them have the leaſt thought; yet by a ſecret Figure of the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary Stile,</hi> perhaps this belongs to all thoſe who either think that the <hi>King</hi> cannot do it by Law, or that will not give their Vote to confirm it in <hi>Parliament:</hi> but I am not ſo well acquainted with all the Myſteries of this <hi>Stile,</hi> as to know its full depth.</p>
               <p>There comes next a long Period of fifty words, for I was at the pains to count them all, which ſeemed a little too prolix for ſo ſhort a <hi>Letter,</hi> eſpecially in one that writes after the <hi>French</hi> Pattern. <hi>But as ever the Happineſs of his Subjects, standing in Liberty of Conſcience, and the Security of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, next the Glory of God, hath been His Majeſties great End; ſo he intends to continue, if he have all ſutable Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:101251:35"/> and Concurrence from you in your Doctrine and Practice.</hi> The putting <hi>ever</hi> at the beginning of the Period, and at ſo great a diſtance from that to which it belongs, is a new Beauty of <hi>Stile.</hi> And the <hi>Standing</hi> of this <hi>Happineſs,</hi> makes me reflect on that which I hear a <hi>Scotch Preacher</hi> delivered in a <hi>Sermon,</hi> that he doubted this <hi>Liberty</hi> would prove but like a <hi>ſtanding Drink.</hi> The <hi>Kings receiving ſutable Encouragement from his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,</hi> agrees ill with the height of <hi>Stile</hi> that went before, of <hi>appointing what the Parliament muſt do. Kings</hi> receive returns of <hi>Duty</hi> and <hi>Obedience</hi> from their <hi>Subjects;</hi> but hitherto <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement</hi> was a word uſed among Equals; the applying it to the <hi>King,</hi> is a new Figure. A man not verſed in the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary-Stile,</hi> would have expreſſed this matter thus: <hi>His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty has ever made the Happineſs of His Subjects, which conſists in Liberty of Conſcience, and the Security of Property, his great end, next to the Glory of God; and he intends to do ſo ſtill, if he receives all ſutable returns from you in your Doctrine and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.</hi> I have marked this the more particularly, to make the difference between the <hi>Common</hi> and the <hi>Secretary-Stile</hi> the more ſenſible. But what need is there of the <hi>Concurrence of the Addreſſers</hi> with the <hi>King,</hi> if he <hi>appoints the next Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to take off all the Penal Laws?</hi> Muſt we likewiſe believe that His Majeſties Zeal for the <hi>Happineſs of His Subjects</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on the Behaviour of theſe <hi>Addreſſers,</hi> and on the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement</hi> that he receives from them, ſo that he will not <hi>continue</hi> it, unleſs they <hi>encourage</hi> him in it? This is but an incertain Tenure, and not like to be <hi>perpetual.</hi> But after all, the <hi>Secretary-Stile</hi> is not the <hi>Royal Stile;</hi> ſo notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this beautiful Period, we hope our Happineſs is more ſteady than to turn upon the <hi>Encouragings</hi> of a few Men; otherwiſe if it is a <hi>ſtanding Happineſs,</hi> yet it is a very tottering one. The <hi>Proteſtant Penal Statutes</hi> is another of his Elegan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies: For ſince all the <hi>Penal Laws,</hi> as well thoſe againſt <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts,</hi> as thoſe againſt <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> were made by <hi>Proteſtant Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments,</hi> one does not ſee how fitly this Epithete comes in here; another would have worded this, thus; <hi>the Penal Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes made againſt Proteſtants.</hi> But the <hi>new Stile</hi> has Figures peculiar to it ſelf, that paſs in the <hi>Common Stile</hi> for <hi>Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieties.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:101251:35"/>
               <p>This Noble <hi>Lord</hi> is not contented to raiſe His Majeſties Glory above all other <hi>Catholick Kings,</hi> in this Grant of <hi>Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or Toleration,</hi> in which there is no Competition to be made; for tho' the Moſt <hi>Chriſtian King,</hi> who is the <hi>Eldeſt Son of that Church,</hi> has indeed executed her <hi>Orders</hi> in their full extent of Severity, yet His Majeſty, who is but the <hi>Cadet</hi> in that <hi>Church</hi>'s Catalogue of Honour, it ſeems does not think that he is yet ſo much beholden to his <hi>Mother,</hi> as to gratifie her by the Deſtruction of his People: yet I ſay, as if this were too little, the <hi>King</hi>'s Glory is here carried farther, even above the <hi>Proteſtant Kings who have gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, whoſe Maxim was to undo you by Fining, Confining, and taking away your Eſtates, and to harraſs you in your Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, Liberties, and Priviledges.</hi> Here is an Honour that is done the King's <hi>Anceſtors</hi> by one of his <hi>Secretaries,</hi> which is indeed new, and of his own Invention: The <hi>Proteſtant Kings</hi> can be no other than the King's <hi>Brother, his Father, and his Grandfather. Kings</hi> ſhut out Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who might have been brought in, if the more general term of <hi>Crowned Heads</hi> had been made uſe of; but as the Writer has ordered it, the Satyr falls ſingly on the King's <hi>Progenitors;</hi> for the <hi>Papers</hi> that were found in the <hi>Strong Box</hi> will go near to put the late <hi>King</hi> out of the Liſt of <hi>Proteſtant Kings;</hi> ſo that this Reprooch lies wholly on the King's <hi>Father</hi> and his <hi>Grandfather.</hi> It is a little ſurpriſing, after all the Eloquence that has been imployed to raiſe the Character of the late <hi>Martyr</hi> to ſo high a pitch, that one of his Son's <hi>Secretaries</hi> ſhould ſet it under his Hand in a <hi>Letter</hi> that he pretends is written by the <hi>King</hi>'s Commands, <hi>That he made it a Maxim to undo his People.</hi> The Writer of this <hi>Letter</hi> ſhould have avoided the mentioning of <hi>Fines,</hi> ſince it is not ſo long ſince both <hi>He</hi> and his <hi>Brother</hi> valued themſelves on a point that they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in the <hi>Council of Scotland,</hi> that <hi>Husbands</hi> ſhould be fined for their <hi>Wives</hi> not going to <hi>Church,</hi> tho' it was not found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on any Law. And of all Men living <hi>he</hi> ought to be the laſt that ſhould ſpeak of <hi>the taking away of Eſtates,</hi> who got a very fair one during the preſent <hi>Reign,</hi> by an <hi>Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> that attainted a <hi>Gentleman</hi> in a <hi>Method</hi> as new as his <hi>Stile</hi> is; upon this ground, that two <hi>Privy Counſellors</hi> decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,

               <p>It ſeems the <hi>New Stile</hi> is not very copious in Words, ſince <hi>Doctrine</hi> is <hi>three</hi> times repeated in ſo ſhort a <hi>Letter.</hi> He tells them, that their <hi>Doctrine muſt tend to cauſe all the Subjects to walk obediently;</hi> now by <hi>obediently</hi> in this <hi>Stile,</hi> is to <hi>obey the Abſolute Power without reſerve;</hi> for to <hi>obey according to Law,</hi> would paſs now for a Crime: This being then his meaning, it is probable that the <hi>Encouragements</hi> which are neceſſary to make His Majeſty continue the happineſs of his Subjects, will not be ſo very great, as to merit the <hi>perpetuating this Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</hi> There is with this a heavy charge laid upon them as to their <hi>Practice, that it muſt be ſuch as ſhall be moſt pleaſing to his Majeſty;</hi> for certainly that can only be by their turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Paſtpis;</hi> ſince a <hi>Prince</hi> that is ſo zealous for his <hi>Religion,</hi> as His Majeſty is, cannot be ſo well pleaſed with any other thing as with this; <hi>Their concurring with the King to remove the Penal Laws,</hi> comes over again; for tho' Repetitions are Impertinencies in the <hi>Common Stile,</hi> they are Flowers in the <hi>new one.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In Concluſion, he tells them, That the <hi>King expects that they will continue their Prayers for him;</hi> yet this does not agree too well with a <hi>Catholick</hi> Zeal; for the Prayers of <hi>damned Hereticks</hi> cannot be worth the asking; for the third time he tells them to <hi>look well to their Doctrine;</hi> now this is a little ambiguous, for it may either ſignifie, that they ſhould ſtudy the Controverſies well, ſo as to be able to defend their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine ſolidly, or that they ſhould ſo mince it, that nothing may fall from them in their <hi>Sermons</hi> againſt <hi>Popery;</hi> this will be indeed a <hi>looking to their Doctrine,</hi> but I do not know whether it will be thought a <hi>looking well to it, or not.</hi> He adds, <hi>That their Example be influential:</hi> I confeſs this hard new word frighted me; I ſuppoſe the meaning of it is, That <hi>their Practice may be ſuch as that it may have an Influence on others;</hi> yet there are both good and bad Influences, a good Influence will be the animating the People to a Zeal for their <hi>Religion,</hi> and a <hi>bad one</hi> will be the ſtackning and ſoftning of that Zeal. A little more clearneſs here had not been amiſs.</p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:101251:36"/>
               <p>As for the laſt Words of this Letter; <hi>That all theſe are his Majeſty's Commands;</hi> it is very hard for me to bring my ſelf to believe them: For certainly he has more Piety for the Memory of the <hi>late Martyr,</hi> and more regard both to <hi>himſelf,</hi> to his <hi>Children,</hi> and to his <hi>People,</hi> than to have ever given any ſuch Commands.</p>
               <p>In order to the communicating this Piece of Elegance to the World, I wiſh the tranſlating it into <hi>French,</hi> were recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to Mr. <hi>d' Albeville,</hi> that it may appear whether the <hi>Secretary-Stile</hi> will look better in his <hi>Iriſh-French,</hi> than it does now in the <hi>Scotch-Engliſh</hi> of him who penned it.</p>

            <head>REFLECTIONS ON A PAMPHLET Entitled, PARLIAMENTUM PACIFICUM, Licenſed by the EARL of <hi>S<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>NDERLAND,</hi> AND Printed at <hi>London,</hi> in <hi>March,</hi> 1688.</head>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>PEace</hi> is a very deſirable thing, yet every State that is <hi>peaceable</hi> is not blindly to be courted. An Apoplexy is the moſt <hi>peaceable</hi> State in which a Man's Body can be laid: yet few would deſire to pacifie the Humours of their Body at that rate. An <hi>Implicite Faith</hi> and <hi>Abſolute Slavery</hi> are the two peaceableſt things that can be; yet we confeſs, we have no mind to try ſo dangerous an Experiment: and while the Remedies are too ſtrong, we will chuſe rather to
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:101251:38"/> bear our Diſeaſe, than to venture on them. The Inſtance that is propoſed to the Imitation of the Nation, is, that <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> which called in the late <hi>King;</hi> and yet that cannot ſo much as be called a <hi>Parliament,</hi> unleſs it be upon a Commonwealth Principle, That <hi>the Sovereign Power is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dically in the People:</hi> For its being choſen without the <hi>King's Writ,</hi> was ſuch an <hi>Eſſential Nullity,</hi> that no ſubſequent Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification could take it away: For all People ſaw, that they could not depend upon any <hi>Acts</hi> paſt by it; and therefore it was quickly diſſolved: and ever ſince it has been called by all the Monarchical Party, a <hi>Convention,</hi> and not a <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> But now, in order to the courting the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth Party, this is not only called a <hi>Parliament,</hi> but is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed as a Pattern to all others, from the beginning to Page 19.</p>
            <p n="2">II. But ſince this Author will ſend us back to that Time, and ſince he takes it ſo ill that <hi>the Memory of the late King ſhould be forgotten;</hi> let us examine that Tranſaction a little, and then we ſhall ſee whether it had not been more for His <hi>Honour</hi> to let it be <hi>forgotten.</hi> The <hi>King</hi> did indeed in his <hi>Declaration</hi> from <hi>Breda</hi> promiſe <hi>Liberty of Conſcience,</hi> on which he inſiſted in a large and wiſe <hi>Declaration,</hi> ſet out after he was ſetled on the Throne: but after that he had got a <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> choſen all of Creatures depending on himſelf, who for many years granted him every thing that he deſired, a ſevere <hi>Act of Uniformity</hi> was paſſed; and the King's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe was carried off by this, <hi>That the King could not refuſe to comply with ſo Loyal a Parliament.</hi> It is well enough known, that thoſe who were then ſecretly <hi>Papists,</hi> and who diſgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed their Religion for many Years after this, as the <hi>King</hi> himſelf did to the laſt, animated the <hi>Chief Men</hi> of our <hi>Church</hi> to carry the Points of <hi>Uniformity</hi> as high as was poſſible; and that both then, and ever ſince, all that propoſed any Expedients for uniting us (or, as it was afterwards termed, for <hi>Comprehending the Diſſenters</hi>) were repreſented as <hi>the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayers of the Church.</hi> The Deſign was then clear to ſome; that ſo by carrying the Terms of <hi>Conformity</hi> to a great rigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, there might be many <hi>Nonconformiſts,</hi> and great occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:101251:38"/> given for a <hi>Toleration,</hi> under which <hi>Popery</hi> might inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly creep in: For if the Expedients that the <hi>King</hi> himſelf propoſed in his <hi>Declaration,</hi> had been ſtood to, it is well known, that of the Two thouſand <hi>Conſciencious Miniſters,</hi> as he calls them, <hi>pag.</hi> 14. by an Affectation too groſs to paſs on them that were turned out, above Seventeen hundred had ſtaid in. Their Practices had but too good Succeſs on thoſe who were then at the Head of our <hi>Church;</hi> whoſe Spirits were too much ſoured by their ill uſage during the War, and whoſe Principles led them to ſo good an Opinion of all that the Court did, that for a great while they would ſuſpect nothing. But at the ſame time that the <hi>Church-Party,</hi> that carried all before them in that <hi>Parliament,</hi> were anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to preſs things ſo hard, the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> were ſecretly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to ſtand out, and were told, that the <hi>King</hi>'s Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and Principle, and the Conſideration of <hi>Trade,</hi> would certainly procure them a <hi>Toleration;</hi> and ever ſince, that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that thus had ſet us together by the ears, has ſhifted Sides dexterouſly enough; but ſtill they have carried on the main Deſign, which was to keep up the Quarrel in the Intervals of Parliament. <hi>Liberty of Conſcience</hi> was in vogue; but when a <hi>Seſſion of Parliament</hi> came, and the <hi>King</hi> wanted Money, then a new ſevere Law againſt the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> was offered to the angry Men of the <hi>Church-Party,</hi> as the Price of it; and this ſeldom failed to have its effect: ſo that they were like the <hi>Jewels of the Crown,</hi> pawned when the <hi>King</hi> needed Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, but redeemed at the next Prorogation. A Reflection then that ariſes naturally out of the Proceedings in the Year 1660. is, That if a <hi>Parliament</hi> ſhould come, that would copy after that Pattern, and repeal <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Teſts,</hi> the <hi>King</hi>'s Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers of <hi>Liberty of Conſcience,</hi> as may indeed be ſuppoſed, will bind him, till after a ſhort Seſſion or two ſuch a meritorious <hi>Parliament</hi> ſhould be diſſolved, according to the Precedent in the Year 1660. and that a new one were brought together by the ſame Methods of changing Charters, and making Returns; and then the old Laws <hi>de Heretico comburendo</hi> might be again revived, and it would be ſaid, that the King's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations are for keeping his Promiſe, and granting ſtill a <hi>Liberty of Conſcience;</hi> yet he can deny nothing to a Loyal and Catholick <hi>Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="68" facs="tcp:101251:39"/>
            <p n="3">III. We pay all poſſible reſpect to the <hi>King,</hi> and have wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed how much we depended on his Promiſes, in ſo ſignal a manner, that after ſuch real Evidence, all Words are ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous. But ſince the <hi>King</hi> has ſhewed ſo much Zeal, not only for his <hi>Religion</hi> in general, but in particular for that <hi>Society,</hi> which of all the other Bodies in it, we know is ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated the moſt againſt us, we muſt crave leave to ſpeak a little freely, and not ſuffer our ſelves to be deſtroyed by a Complement. The <hi>Extirpation of Hereticks,</hi> and the <hi>Breach of Faith to them,</hi> have been decreed by two of their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Councils and by a Tradition of ſeveral Ages; the <hi>Pope</hi> is poſſeſſed of a <hi>Power of diſſolving all Promiſes, Contracts, and Oaths;</hi> not to mention the private Doctrines of that <hi>Society,</hi> that is ſo much in favour, of <hi>doing Ill that Good may come of it, of uſing Equivocations and Reſervations, and of ordering the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.</hi> Now theſe Opinions, as they have never been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced by the Body of that <hi>Church,</hi> ſo indeed they cannot be, unleſs they renounce their Infallibility, which is their <hi>Baſis,</hi> at the ſame time. Therefore tho a Prince of that Communion may very ſincerely reſolve to maintain <hi>Liberty of Conſcience,</hi> and to <hi>keep his Word,</hi> yet the blind Subjection into which he is brought by his Religion, to his Church, muſt force him to break thro' all that, as ſoon as the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of his Church is opened to him, and that Abſolution is denied him, or higher Threatnings are made him, if he continues firm to his merciful Inclinations. So that ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing His Majeſty's Piety to be as <hi>great</hi> as the <hi>Jeſuit</hi>'s Sermon on the Thirtieth of <hi>January,</hi> lately printed, carries it, to <hi>the uttermoſt poſſibility of Fleſh and Blood,</hi> then our Fears muſt ſtill grow upon us, who know what are the Decrees of that <hi>Church;</hi> and by conſequence we may infer, to what his Piety muſt needs carry him, as ſoon as thoſe things are fully opened to him, which in <hi>reſpect to him,</hi> we are bound to believe are now hid from him.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. It will further appear, that theſe are not unjuſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, if we conſider a little what has been the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of all the Promiſes made for <hi>Liberty of Conſcience</hi> to
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:101251:39"/> Hereticks by <hi>Roman Catholick Princes,</hi> ever ſince the <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> The firſt was, the <hi>Edict of Paſſaw</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red chiefly by <hi>Ferdinand</hi>'s means, and maintained indeed religiouſly by his Son <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Second, whoſe Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations to the Proteſtant Religion made him be ſuſpected for one himſelf: But the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> inſinuated themſelves ſo far into his younger <hi>Brother</hi>'s Court, that was Archduke of <hi>Grats,</hi> that this was not only broken by that Family, in their Share, but tho' <hi>Rodolph</hi> and <hi>Mathias</hi> were Princes of great Gentleneſs, and the latter of theſe was the Protector of the <hi>States</hi> in the beginning of their War with King <hi>Philip</hi> the Second, yet the Violence with which the Houſe of <hi>Grats</hi> was poſſeſſed, overturned all that: ſo that the breaking of the Pacificatory <hi>Edicts</hi> was begun in <hi>Rodolph</hi>'s time, and was ſo far carried on in <hi>Mathias</hi>'s time, that they ſet both <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemia</hi> and <hi>Hungary</hi> in a Flame, and ſo begun that long War of <hi>Germany.</hi> 2. The next Promiſe for <hi>Liberty of Conſcience</hi> was made by Queen <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>England;</hi> but we know well enough how it was obſerved: the Promiſes made by the Queen <hi>Regent</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> were obſerved with the ſame Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity. After theſe came the Pacificatory <hi>Edicts</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> which were ſcarce made when the <hi>Triumvirate</hi> was formed to break them. The famous <hi>Maſſacre of Paris</hi> was an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance never to be forgot, of the Religious Obſervance of a Treaty, made on purpoſe to lay the Party aſleep, and to bring the whole Heads of it into the Net; this was a much more <hi>dreadful St. Bartholomew,</hi> than that on which our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor beſtows that Epithete, <hi>pag.</hi> 15. and when all ſeemed ſetled by the famous <hi>Edict</hi> of <hi>Nantes,</hi> we have ſeen how reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs that Party, and in particular the <hi>Society,</hi> were, till it was broken by a Prince, that for thirty years together had ſhewed as great an averſion to the <hi>Shedding of Blood</hi> in his Government at home, as any of his Neighbours can pretend to; and who has done nothing in the whole Tragedy that he has acted, but what is exactly conform to the Doctrine and Decrees of his Church: ſo that is not <hi>himſelf,</hi> but <hi>his Religion,</hi> that we muſt blame for all that has fallen out in that Kingdom. I cannot leave this, without taking notice
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:101251:40"/> of our Author's Sincerity, who pag. 18. tells us of the <hi>Proteſtants entring into their League in France,</hi> when it is well known that it was a <hi>League of Papiſts againſt a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Succeſſor,</hi> which was afterwards applied to a <hi>Popiſh King,</hi> only becauſe he was not zealous enough againſt <hi>Hereticks.</hi> But to end this Liſt of Inſtances at a Country to which our Author bears ſo particular a kindneſs; when the Dutcheſs of <hi>Parma</hi> granted the <hi>Edict</hi> of Pacifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, by which all that was paſt was buried, and the Exerciſe of the Proteſtant Religion was to be connived at for the future; King <hi>Philip</hi> the Second did not only ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie this, but expreſſed himſelf ſo fully upon it to the Count of <hi>Egmont,</hi> who had been ſent over to him, that the eaſie <hi>Count</hi> returned to <hi>Flanders</hi> ſo aſſured of the <hi>King</hi>'s Sincerity, that he endeavoured to perſwade all others to rely as much on his Word, as he himſelf did. It is well known how fatal this Confidence was to him, and (ſee <hi>Meteren.</hi> lib. 3.) that two years after this that <hi>King</hi> ſent over the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> with that ſevere Commiſſion which has been often printed, in which, without any regard had to the former Pacification or Promiſes, the <hi>King</hi> declared, <hi>that the Provinces had forfeited all their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, and that every man in it had forfeited his life;</hi> and therefore he authoriſed that <hi>unmerciful Man</hi> to proceed with all poſſible Rigour againſt them. It is alſo remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that that bloody Commiſſion is founded on the King's <hi>Abſolute Power,</hi> and his Zeal for Religion. This is the only <hi>Edict</hi> that I know, in which a <hi>King</hi> has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to <hi>Abſolute Power,</hi> before the <hi>two Declarations</hi> for <hi>Scotland</hi> in the year 1687. ſo whether they who penned them took their Pattern from this, I cannot determine it. I could carry this view of Hiſtory much further, to ſhew in many more Inſtances, how little <hi>Proteſtants</hi> can depend on the Faith of <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> and that their Condition is ſo much the worſe, the more pious that their Princes are. As for what may be objected to all this, from the preſent State of ſome Principalities or Towns in <hi>Germany,</hi> or of the <hi>Switzers</hi> and <hi>Griſons;</hi> it is to be conſidered, that in ſome of theſe, want of Power in the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:101251:40"/> 
               <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> to do miſchief, and the other Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of their Affairs, are viſibly the only Securities of the <hi>Protestants;</hi> and whenſoever this Nation departs from that, and gives up the <hi>Laws,</hi> it is no hard thing to gueſs how ſhort-lived the <hi>Liberty of Conſcience,</hi> even tho' ſetled into a <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> would be.</p>
            <p n="5">V. All that our Author ſays upon the General Subject of <hi>Liberty of Conſcience,</hi> is only a ſevere Libel upon that <hi>Church,</hi> whoſe Principles and Practices are ſo contrary to it. But the Propoſition lately made, has put an end to all this Diſpute; ſince by an Offer of Repealing the <hi>Penal Laws,</hi> reſerving only thoſe of the <hi>Teſt,</hi> and ſuch others as ſecure the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> the queſtion is now no more, which Religion muſt be <hi>tolerated,</hi> but which Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion muſt <hi>reign</hi> and prevail. All that is here offered in Oppoſition to that, is, that by this means <hi>ſuch a number of Perſons muſt be ruined,</hi> Pag. 64. <hi>which is as ſevere a way of forcing People to change their Religion, as the way of Dragoons.</hi> I will not examine the particulars of this matter, but muſt expreſs my joy to find, that all the Difficulty which is in our way to a happy quiet, is the ſupplying ſuch a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of men with the means of their ſubſiſtance, which by the Execution of the <hi>Law</hi> for the <hi>Teſt,</hi> muſt be taken from them. This by all that I can learn, will not come to near an Hundred Thouſand Pound a year; and indeed the ſupplying of thoſe of the <hi>King</hi>'s Religion, that want it, is a piece of Charity and Bounty ſo worthy of him, that I do not know a man that would envy them the double of this in Penſions: and if ſuch a Sum would a little charge the <hi>King</hi>'s Revenue, I dare ſay, when the Settlement of the Nation is brought to that ſingle point, there would not be one Negative found in either <hi>Houſe of Parliament,</hi> for the reimburſing the <hi>King:</hi> So far are we from deſiring either the Deſtruction, or even the Poverty of thoſe that perhaps wait only for an occaſion to burn us. I will add one bold thing further, that tho' I will be no undertaker for what a <hi>Parliament</hi> may do, yet I am confident that all men are ſo far from any deſire of Revenge, but moſt
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:101251:41"/> of all, that the <hi>Heroical Minds</hi> of the <hi>next Succeſſors</hi> are above it; that if an <hi>Indemnity</hi> for that bold violation of the <hi>Law</hi> that has been of late both practiſed and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſed among us, would procure a full Settlement, even this could be obtained, tho' an Impunity after ſuch Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, is perhaps too great an Encouragement to offend for the future. But ſince it is the Preſervation of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not the ruine of any party in it, that is aimed at, the Hardineſs of this Propoſition will, I hope, be forgiven me. It is urged, pag. 63. that according to the <hi>Dutch</hi> Pattern at leaſt the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> may have a ſhare in Military Employments; but the difference between our Caſe and theirs, is clear; ſince ſome <hi>Roman Catholick Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,</hi> where the Government is wholly in the Hands of of <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> cannot be of ſuch dangerous Conſequence as it muſt needs be under a <hi>King</hi> that is not only of that Perſwaſion, but is become nearly allied to the <hi>Society,</hi> as the <hi>Liege Letter</hi> tells us.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. It is true, our Author would perſwade us, that the <hi>King</hi>'s diſpenſing Power has already put an end to the Diſpute, and that therefore it is a <hi>ſeeming ſort of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury,</hi> ſee pag. 48. <hi>to keep the Juſtices of Peace ſtill under an Oath of executing thoſe Laws,</hi> which they muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider no more. Some Preſidents are brought from for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times, pag. 22, 23, 24. of our <hi>Kings</hi> uſing the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſing Power in <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, and Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s time. It is very true, that the <hi>Laws</hi> have been of late broke through among us with a very high hand, but it is a little too dangerous to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid the <hi>Juſtices of Peace</hi> with their <hi>Oaths,</hi> leſt this oblige them to reflect on ſo ſacred an Engagement; for the worthy Members of <hi>Magdalen Colledge</hi> are not the only Perſons in <hi>England,</hi> who will make Conſcience of obſerving their <hi>Oaths;</hi> ſo that if others are brought to reflect too much on what they do, our Author's Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiouſneſs in ſuggeſting this to them, may prove to be no acceptable piece of ſervce. I will not examine all his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidents;
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:101251:41"/> we are to be governed by <hi>Law,</hi> and not by ſome of the <hi>exceſſes of Government;</hi> nor is the latter end of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the Third a time to be much imitated: and of all the parts of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Hiſtory, <hi>Richard</hi> the Second's Reign ſhould be the leaſt mentioned, ſince thoſe <hi>exceſſes</hi> of his produced ſo Tragical a Concluſion as the loſs of <hi>his</hi> Crown and Life. <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth's feeble and imbroiled Reign will ſcarce ſupport an Argument; and if there were ſome <hi>exceſſes</hi> in <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the Eighth's time, which is ordinary in all great Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, he got all theſe to be either warranted, or afterwards confirmed in <hi>Parliament.</hi> And Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Power in Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical matters was founded on a ſpecial <hi>Act of Parliament,</hi> which was in a great meaſure repealed in the year 1641. and that Repeal was again ratified by another <hi>Act</hi> in the late <hi>King</hi>'s time. We are often told of the late <hi>King</hi>'s repealing the <hi>Act</hi> concerning the Siſe of <hi>Carts</hi> and <hi>Waggons;</hi> but all Lawyers know that ſome <hi>Laws</hi> are underſtood to be <hi>abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated</hi> without a ſpecial <hi>Repeal,</hi> when ſome viſible Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience enforces it; ſuch as appeared in that miſtaken <hi>Act</hi> concerning <hi>Waggons;</hi> ſo the <hi>King</hi> in that caſe only declared the Inconvenience which made that <hi>Law</hi> to be of it ſelf null becauſe it was impracticable. It is true, the <hi>Parliament</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver queſtioned this; a man would not be offended if another pulled a Flower in his Garden, that yet would take it ill if he broke his Hedge: and in <hi>Holland,</hi> to which our Author's Pen leads him often, when a River changes its courſe, any man may break the <hi>Dike</hi> that was made to reſiſt it, yet that will be no warrant to go and break the Dike that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts the Current of the ſame River: So if a diſpenſing Power, when applied to ſmaller Offences, has been paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed over, as an <hi>exceſs of Government,</hi> that might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable, tho' not juſtifiable, this will by no means prove, that <hi>Laws</hi> made to ſecure us againſt that which we eſteem the <hi>greateſt of Evils</hi> may be ſuperſeded, becauſe <hi>twelve Men</hi> in <hi>Scarlet</hi> have been hired or practiſed on to ſay ſo; the Power of <hi>pardoning</hi> is alſo unreaſonably ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for juſtifying the <hi>Diſpenſing Power;</hi> the one is a Grace to a particular Perſon for a Crime committed, whereas the other is a warrant to commit Crimes. In
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:101251:42"/> ſhort, the one is a Power to <hi>ſave Men,</hi> and the other is a Power to <hi>deſtroy the Government.</hi> But tho' they ſwagger it out now with the <hi>Diſpenſing Power,</hi> yet <hi>rode caper vitem</hi> may come to be again in ſeaſon; and a time may come, in which the whole Party will have reaſon to wiſh that ſome hair-brained <hi>Jeſuits</hi> had never been born, who will rather expoſe them not only to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentments, but even to the Juſtice of another ſeaſon, in which as little regard will be had to the <hi>Diſpenſing Power,</hi> as they have to the <hi>Laws</hi> at preſent, then accept of reaſonable Propoſitions.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. Our Author's Kindneſs to the <hi>States of Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> is very particular, and returns often upon him, and it is no wonder that a <hi>State</hi> ſetled upon two ſuch Hinges, as the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> and <hi>publick Liberty,</hi> ſhould be no ſmall Eye ſore to thoſe who intend to deſtroy both So that the ſlackning the <hi>Laws</hi> concerning <hi>Religion,</hi> and the invading that <hi>State,</hi> ſeem to be Terms that muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways go together. In the firſt War began the firſt ſlack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of them; and after the <hi>Triple Alliance</hi> had laid the <hi>Dutch</hi> aſleep, when the ſecond War was reſolved on, which began with that Heroical Attempt on the <hi>Smyrna Fleet,</hi> (for our Author will not have the late <hi>King</hi>'s Actions to be <hi>forgotten</hi>) at the ſame time the famous <hi>Declaration</hi> ſuſpending the <hi>Laws</hi> in 1672. came out; and now again with another <hi>Declaration</hi> to the ſame purpoſe, we ſee a return of the ſame good Inclinations for the <hi>Dutch,</hi> tho' none before our Author has ever ventured in a Book licenſed by my Lord <hi>Preſident</hi> of the <hi>Council,</hi> to call that Conſtitution, pag. 68. <hi>A Revolt that they made from their lawful Prince;</hi> and to raiſe his ſtile to a more ſublime Strain, he ſays, pag. 66. <hi>That their Commonwealth is only the Reſult of an abſolute Rebellion, Revolt, and Defection from their Prince; and that the Laws that they have made, were to prevent any caſual return to their natural Allegiance.</hi> And ſpeaking of their Obligation to protect a Natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized Subject, he beſtows this Honour on them, as to ſay, pag. 57, 58. <hi>Thoſe that never yet dealt ſo fairly with
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:101251:42"/> Princes, may be ſuſpected for ſuch a ſuperfluous Faith to one that puts himſelf upon them for a Vaſſal.</hi> Time will ſhew how far the States will reſent theſe Injuries; only it ſeems our Author thinks, that a Soveraign's Faith to protect the Subject, is a <hi>ſuperfluous thing;</hi> a Faith to Hereticks is another <hi>ſuperfluous thing;</hi> ſo that two Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluities, one upon another, muſt be all that we are to truſt to. But I muſt take notice of the variety of Methods that theſe Gentlemen uſe in their Writings. Here in <hi>England</hi> we are always upbraided with the <hi>Revolt of the Dutch,</hi> as a ſcandalous Imputation on the <hi>Protestant Religion;</hi> and yet in a late Paper, entituled, <hi>An Anſwer to Penſioner Fagel's Letter,</hi> the Services that the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> did in the beginning of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, are highly extolled as ſignal and merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious; upon which the Writer makes great Complaints, That the <hi>Pacification of Gaunt,</hi> and the <hi>Union at Utrecht,</hi> by which the free Exerciſe of their Religion was to be continued to them, was not obſerved in moſt of the <hi>Provinces:</hi> But if he had taken pains to examine the Hiſtory of the <hi>States,</hi> he would have found, that ſoon after the <hi>Union</hi> made at <hi>Utrecht,</hi> the Treaty at <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> was ſet on foot, between the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and the <hi>States,</hi> by the <hi>Emperor</hi>'s Mediation, in which the <hi>Spaniars</hi> ſtudied to divide the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> of theſe <hi>Provinces</hi> from the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> by offering a Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the other <hi>Priviledges</hi> of theſe <hi>Provinces,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting only the Point of <hi>Religion,</hi> which had ſo great an Effect, that the Party of the <hi>Malcontents</hi> was form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon it; and theſe did quickly capitulate in the <hi>Walloon Provinces;</hi> and after that not only <hi>Barbant</hi> and <hi>Flanders</hi> capitulated, but <hi>Reenenburgh</hi> that was Governour of <hi>Groening,</hi> declared for the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and by ſome Places that he took both in <hi>Friſeland</hi> and <hi>Over-Iſſel,</hi> he put theſe <hi>Provinces</hi> under Contribution. Not long after that, both <hi>Daventer</hi> and <hi>Zutphen</hi> were betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Popiſh</hi> Governours; and the War was thus brought within the <hi>Seven</hi> Provinces, that had been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:101251:43"/> kept at a greater diſtance from them. Thus it did appear almoſt every where, that the hatred with which the <hi>Prieſts</hi> were inſpiring the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> againſt the <hi>Protestants,</hi> diſpoſed them to betray all again to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Tyranny. The new War that <hi>Reenenburgh</hi>'s Treachery had brought into theſe <hi>Provinces,</hi> changed ſo the State of Affairs, that no wonder if this produced a change likewiſe with relation to that Religion, ſince it appeared, that theſe Revolts were carried on, and juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied upon the Principles of that <hi>Church;</hi> and the general Hatred under which theſe Revolts brought the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> in thoſe <hi>Out Provinces,</hi> made the greater part of them to withdraw; ſo that there were not left ſuch numbers of them as to pretend to the free Exerciſe of their Religion. But the War not having got into <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Utrecht,</hi> and none of that Religion having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted in thoſe Provinces, the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ſtill in the Country; and tho' the ill Inclinations that they ſhewed, made it neceſſary for the publick Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to put them out of the Government, yet they have ſtill enjoyed the common Rights of the Country, with the free Exerciſe of their Religion. But it is plain, that ſome men are only waiting an opportunity to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new the old <hi>Delenda eſt Carthago,</hi> and that they think it is no ſmall ſtep to it, to poſſeſs all the World with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Impreſſions of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> as a <hi>rebellious and perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious State;</hi> and if it were poſſible, they would even make their own <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> Subjects fancy that they are perſecuted by them: But tho' men may be brought to believe <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> in ſpite of the Evidence of Senſe to the contrary, yet thoſe that feel themſelves at eaſe, will hardly be brought to think that they are perſecuted, becauſe they are told ſo in an ill-writ <hi>Pamphlet.</hi> And for their Rebellion, the <hi>Prince</hi> that is only concerned in that, finds them now to be his <hi>beſt Allies,</hi> and <hi>chief Supports,</hi> as his Predeceſſors acknowledged them a <hi>Free State,</hi> almoſt an Age ago. And it being confeſſed by the Hiſtorians of all ſides, That there was an expreſs Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſo
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:101251:43"/> in the Conſtitution of their Government, <hi>That if their Prince broke ſuch and ſuch Limits, they were no more bound to obey him, but might reſist him;</hi> and it being no leſs certain, that King <hi>Philip</hi> the Second authoriſed the the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> to ſeiſe upon all their Priviledges, their reſiſting him, and maintaining their Priviledges, was without all Diſpute, a juſtifiabble Action, and was ſo eſteemed by all the <hi>States</hi> of <hi>Europe,</hi> and in particular here in <hi>England,</hi> as appears by the <hi>Preambles</hi> of ſeveral <hi>Acts of Subſidy</hi> that were given the <hi>Queen</hi> in order to the aſſiſting the <hi>States;</hi> and as for their <hi>not dealing fairly with Princes,</hi> when our Author can find ſuch an Inſtance in their Hiſtory, as our Attempt upon their <hi>Smyrna Fleet</hi> was, he may employ his Eloquence in ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it out; and if notwithſtanding all the Failures that they have felt from others, they have ſtill main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the Publick Faith, our Author's Rhetorick will hardly blemiſh them. The Peace of <hi>Nimmegen,</hi> and the abandoning of <hi>Luxemburgh,</hi> are perhaps the ſingle Inſtances in their Hiſtory that need to be a little ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed. But as the vaſt Expence of the late War brought them into a Neceſſity that either knows no Law, or at leaſt will hearken to none; ſo we, who forced them to both, and firſt ſold the <hi>Triple Alliance,</hi> and then let go <hi>Luxemburgh,</hi> do with a very ill grace reproach the <hi>Dutch</hi> for theſe unhappy ſteps to which our Conduct drove them.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. If a ſtrain of pert bolneſs runs thro this whole <hi>Pamphlet,</hi> it appears no where more eminently, than in the <hi>Reflections</hi> the Author makes on Mr. <hi>Fagel's Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:</hi> He calls it, pag. 62. a <hi>pretended Piece,</hi> and a <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption not to be ſoon pardoned, in prefixing to a ſurrepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and unauthoriſed Pamphlet the Reverend Name of the Princeſs of</hi> Orange; which in another place (Page 72.) he had reaſon to imagine; was <hi>but a Counterfeit Coin, and that thoſe Venerable Characters were but politically feigned, and a Sacred Title given to it without their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</hi>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:101251:44"/> All this coming out with ſo ſolemn a Licenſe, has made me take ſome pains to be rightly informed in this matter; thoſe whom I conſulted, tell me, they have diſcourſed the <hi>Penſioner</hi> himſelf on this Subject, who will very ſhortly take a ſure Method to clear himſelf of thoſe Imputations; and to do that right to the <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,</hi> as to ſhew the World, that in this matter he acted only by their Order. For as Mr. <hi>Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>art</hi>'s Letter drew the <hi>Penſioner</hi>'s Anſwer from him, ſo this Paper, <hi>licenſed as it is,</hi> will now draw from him a particular Recital of the whole Progreſs of this Matter. Mr. <hi>Albeville</hi> knows, that the <hi>Princeſs</hi> explained her ſelf ſo fully to him in the Month of <hi>May</hi> and <hi>June,</hi> 1687. upon the Repeal of the <hi>Teſt,</hi> that he himſelf has acknowledged to ſeveral Perſons, that though both the <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Princeſs</hi> were very ſtiff in that matter, yet of the two, he found the <hi>Princeſs</hi> more inflexible. Afterwards when Mr. <hi>Stewart,</hi> by many repeated Letters, preſſed his Friend to renew his Importunities to the <hi>Penſioner</hi> for an Anſwer; he having alſo ſaid in his <hi>Letters,</hi> That he writ by the <hi>King's Order</hi> and Direction: Upon this, the <hi>Penſioner</hi> having conſulted the <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Princeſs,</hi> drew his Letter firſt in <hi>Dutch,</hi> and communicated it to them; and it being approved by them, he turned it into <hi>Latine:</hi> but becauſe it was to be ſhewed to the <hi>King,</hi> he thought it was fit to get it to be put in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> that ſo their <hi>Highneſſes</hi> might ſee that Tranſlation of his <hi>Letter,</hi> which was to be offered to His Majeſty;
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:101251:44"/> and they having approved of it, he ſent it with his own in <hi>Latine,</hi> and it was delivered to the <hi>King.</hi> This Account was given me by my Friend, who added, that it would appear e're long in a more Authentical manner. And by this I ſuppoſe the Impudence of thoſe men does ſufficiently appear, who have the Brow to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh ſuch Stuff, of the Falſhood of which they themſelves are well aſſured: And therefore I may well conclude, that my Lord Preſident's <hi>Licenſe</hi> was granted by him, with that Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſsneſs with which moſt Books are read and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed. Our Author pretends, that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not believe that this <hi>Letter</hi> could flow from a <hi>Princeſs</hi> of <hi>ſo ſweet a Temper,</hi> pag. 62. and yet others find ſo much of the <hi>Sweetneſs</hi> of her <hi>Temper</hi> in it, that for that very reaſon they believe it the more eaſily to have come from her. No Paſſion or indiſcreet Zeal appears in it; and it expreſſes ſuch an extended Charity and Nobleneſs of Temper, that theſe Characters ſhew it comes from one that has neither a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowneſs of Soul, nor a ſourneſs of Spirit. In ſhort, She propoſes nothing in it, but to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that <hi>Religion</hi> which ſhe believes the <hi>true one;</hi> and that being ſecured, ſhe is willing that all others enjoy all the <hi>Liberties of Subjects,</hi> and the <hi>Freedoms of Chriſtians.</hi> Here is <hi>Sweetneſs of Temper</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian Charity</hi> in their fulleſt extent. The other Reaſon is ſo myſteriouſly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, that I will not wrong our Author by putting it in any other words than his own,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:101251:45"/> pag. 62. <hi>She is certainly as little pleaſed to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote any thing to the Diſturbance of a State, to which ſhe ſtill ſeems ſo nearly related.</hi> She <hi>ſeems ſtill,</hi> are two ſignificant Words, and not ſet here for nothing. <hi>She ſeems</hi> (in his Opinion) only <hi>related</hi> to the <hi>Crown;</hi> that is, She is not really ſo: but there is ſomething that theſe Gentlemen have in reſerve to blow up this <hi>ſeeming</hi> Relation. And She <hi>ſeems ſtill,</hi> imports, that though this apparent Relation is ſuffered to paſs at preſent, yet it muſt have its Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod; for this <hi>ſeems ſtill,</hi> can have no other meaning. But in what does She promote the <hi>Diſturbance of the State,</hi> or <hi>Patroniſe the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers of her Parents?</hi> as he ſays afterwards (ibid.) Did She officiouſly interpoſe in this matter, or was not her Senſe asked? And when it was asked, muſt She not give it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to her Conſcience? She is too per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect a Pattern in all other things, not to know well how great a <hi>Reſpect</hi> and <hi>Submiſſion</hi> She owes her <hi>Father:</hi> but She is too good a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, not to know that her Duty to God muſt go firſt: And therefore in matters of <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> when Her Mind was asked, She could not avoid the giving it according to her Conſcience; and all the invidious Expreſſions which he faſtens on this <hi>Letter,</hi> and which he makes ſo many Arguments to ſhew that it could not flow from Her, are all the malicious and ſoon-diſcovered Artifices of one that knew that She had ordered the <hi>Letter,</hi> and that thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſafe in this Diſguiſe, in the diſcharging of
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:101251:45"/> his Malice againſt her. So ingratefully is ſhe required by a Party for whom ſhe had expreſſed ſo much Compaſſion and Charity. This Author, <hi>Pag.</hi> 53. thinks it is an <hi>inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent forecaſt to be always erecting ſuch Schemes for the next Heir, both in Diſcourſe and Writing, as ſeem almoſt to calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the Nativity of the preſent:</hi> and he would almoſt make this <hi>High-Treaſon.</hi> But if it is ſo, there were many <hi>Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi> in <hi>England</hi> a few Years ago; in which the <hi>next Heir,</hi> though but a <hi>Brother,</hi> was ſo much conſidered, that the King himſelf look'd as one out of Countenance and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, and could ſcarce find Company enough about him for his Entertainment, either in his Bed-Chamber or in his Walks; when the whole Dependance was on the <hi>Succeſſor:</hi> ſo if we by turns look a little at the <hi>Succeſſor,</hi> thoſe who did this in ſo ſcandalous a manner, ought not to take it ſo very ill from us. In a melancholy State of things, it is hard to deny us the Conſolation of hoping that we may ſee <hi>better Days.</hi> But ſince our Author is ſo much concerned, that this <hi>Letter</hi> ſhould not be in any manner imputed to the <hi>Princeſs,</hi> it ſeems a little ſtrange, that the <hi>Prince</hi> is ſo given up by him, that he is at no pains to clear him of the Imputation. For the happy Union that is between them, will readily make us conclude, that if the <hi>Prince</hi> ordered it, the <hi>Princeſs</hi> had likewiſe her ſhare in it. I find but one glance at the <hi>Prince</hi> in the whole Book, <hi>Pag.</hi> 52. when the Author is pleaſing himſelf with the hopes of Protection from the <hi>Royal Heir</hi> out of a ſenſe of <hi>Filial Duty:</hi> He concludes, <hi>Eſpecially when ſo nearly allied to the very Boſom of a Prince whoſe way of Worſhip neither is the ſame with the National here, and in whoſe Countries all Religions have been ever alike tolerated.</hi> The Phraſe of <hi>ſo near an Alliance to the very Boſom of a Prince,</hi> is ſomewhat extraordinary: An Author that will be florid, ſcorns ſo ſimple an Expreſſion as <hi>married;</hi> he thought the other was more lofty. But the matter of this Period is more remarkable: it intimates as if the <hi>Prince</hi>'s way of Worſhip was ſo different from ours; tho we hear that he goes frequently with the <hi>Princeſs</hi> to her Chappel: and expreſſes no averſion to any of our Forms, tho he thinks it decent to be more conſtantly in the Exerciſes of Devotion that are authoriſed in <hi>Holland.</hi> And as for that, that <hi>all Religions have been ever alike tolerated there,</hi> it is another of our
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:101251:46"/> Author's flights. I do not hear that there are either <hi>Bonzis</hi> or <hi>Bramans</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> or that the <hi>Mahometans</hi> have their <hi>Moſques</hi> there: And ſure his Friends the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> will tell him, that <hi>all Religions</hi> are not <hi>alike tolerated there.</hi> Thus I have followed him more largely in this Article, than in any other, it being that of the greateſt Importance, by which he had endeavoured to blaſt all the good effects which the <hi>Penſioners Letter</hi> has had among us.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. I have now gone over that, which I thought moſt important in this Paper: and in which it ſeemed neceſſary to inform the Publick aright, without inſiſting on the particular Slips of the Author of it, or of the Advantages that he gives to any that would anſwer him more particularly. I cannot think that any Man in the Nation can be now ſo weak, as not to ſee what muſt needs be the effect of the Abolition of the <hi>Teſt:</hi> after all that we ſee and hear, it is too great an Affront to Mankind to offer to make it out. A Man's Underſtanding may really miſlead him ſo far as to make him change his <hi>Religion,</hi> he remaining ſtill an <hi>honeſt Man;</hi> but no Man can pretend to be thought an <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Man,</hi> that betrays the legal, and now the only viſible Defences of that <hi>Religion</hi> which he profeſſes. The taking away the <hi>Teſt</hi> for publick Employments, is to ſet up an Office at Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Peter</hi>'s for all Pretenders; and perhaps a Pretender will not be ſo much as received, till he has firſt abjured; ſo that every Vacancy will probably make five or ſix Profelites; and thoſe <hi>Proteſtants</hi> who are already in Employments, will feel their ground quickly fail under them, and upon the firſt Complaint, they will ſee what muſt be done to reſtore them to favour. And as for the two Houſes of <hi>Parliament,</hi> as a great <hi>Creation</hi> will preſently give them the Majority in the Houſe of <hi>Lords:</hi> ſo a new ſet of <hi>Charters,</hi> and bold <hi>Returns,</hi> will in a little time give them likewiſe the Majority in the Houſe of <hi>Commons:</hi> and if it is to be ſuppoſed that <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> who have all the Security of the <hi>Law</hi> for their <hi>Religion,</hi> can throw that up; who can ſo much as doubt that when they have brought themſelves into ſo naked a condition, it will be no hard thing to overturn their whole Eſtabliſhment? and then perhaps we ſhall be told more plainly, what is now but darkly inſinuated to us by this Author; that the next Heir <hi>ſeems ſtill to be ſo nearly related to this State.</hi>

            <head>AN APOLOGY FOR THE CHURCH of <hi>ENGLAND,</hi> With Relation to the Spirit of PERSECUTION, For which She is accuſed.</head>
            <p n="1">I. ONE ſhould think that the Behaviour of the <hi>Engliſh Clergy</hi> for ſome Years paſt, and the preſent Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances in which they are, ſhould ſet them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond <hi>Slander,</hi> and by conſequence above <hi>Apologies;</hi> yet ſince the Malice of her Enemies works againſt her with ſo much <hi>Spight,</hi> and ſince there is no Inſinuation that carries ſo much Malice in it, and that ſeems to have ſuch colours of Truth on it, as this of their having ſet on a ſevere <hi>Perſecution</hi> againſt the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> of being ſtill ſour'd with that Leaven, and of carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame implacable Hatred to them, which the preſent Reputation that they have gained may put them in a further capacity of executing, if another Revolution of Affairs ſhould again give them Authority ſet about it; it ſeems neceſſary to examine it, and that the rather, becauſe ſome aggravate this ſo far, as if nothing were now to be ſo much dreaded as the Church of <hi>England</hi>'s getting out of her preſent Diſtreſs.</p>
            <p n="2">II. If theſe Imputations were charged on us only by thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> we ſhould not much wonder at it; for though it argues a good degree of Confidence for any of
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:101251:47"/> that Communion to declaim againſt the Severities that have been put in Practice among us, ſince their <hi>little Finger muſt be heavier than ever our Loins</hi> were, and to whoſe <hi>Scorpions</hi> our <hi>Rods</hi> ought not to be compared; yet after all, we are ſo much accuſtomed to their Methods, that nothing from them can ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe us. To hear <hi>Papiſts</hi> declare againſt Perſecution, and <hi>Jeſuits</hi> cry up Liberty of Conſcience, are, we confeſs, unuſual things: yet there are ſome degrees of Shame, over which when People are once paſſed, all things become ſo familiar to them, that they can no more be put out of countenance. But it ſeems very ſtrange to us, that ſome, who if they are to be believed, are ſtrict to the ſevereſt Forms and Sub-diviſions of the Reformed Religion, and who ſome Years ago were jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of the ſmalleſt ſteps that the Court made, when the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger was more remote, and who cried out <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> when the deſign was ſo mask'd, that ſome well-meaning Men could not miſs being deceived by the Promiſes that were made, and the Diſguiſes that were put on; that, I ſay, theſe very Perſons who were formerly ſo diſtruſtful, ſhould now, when the Mask is laid off, and the Deſign is avowed, of a ſudden grow to be ſo believing, as to throw off all Diſtruſt, and be ſo gulled as to betray all; and to expoſe us to the Rage of thoſe, who muſt needs give ſome good words, till they have gone the round, and tried how effectually they can divide and deceive us, that ſo they may deſtroy us the more eaſily; this is indeed ſomewhat extraordinary. They are not ſo ignorant as not to know, that Popery cannot change its Nature, and that <hi>Cruelty and Breach of Faith to Hereticks,</hi> are as neceſſary parts of that Religion, as <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> and the <hi>Pope's Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy</hi> are. If Papiſts were not Fools, they muſt give good Words and fair Promiſes, till by theſe they have ſo far de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded the poor credulous Hereticks, that they may put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in a poſture to execute the Decrees of their Church a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them; and though we accuſe that Religion as guilty both of <hi>Cruelty</hi> and <hi>Treachery,</hi> yet we do not think them Fools: ſo till their Party is ſtronger than God be thanked it is at preſent, they can take no other method than that they take. The Church of <hi>England</hi> was the Word among them ſomſt Years ago, <hi>Liberty of Conſcieece</hi> is the Word at preſent;
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:101251:47"/> and we have all poſſible reaſon to aſſure us, that the Promiſes for maintaining the one, will be as religiouſly kept as we ſee thoſe are which were lately made with ſo great a profuſion of Proteſtations, and ſhews of Friendſhip for the ſupporting of the other.</p>
            <p n="3">III. It were great Injuſtice to charge all the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> with the Impertinencies that have appeared in many Addreſſes of late, or to take our meaſures of them, from the impudent ſtrains of an <hi>Alſop</hi> or a <hi>Care,</hi> or from the more important and now more viſible ſteps that ſome among them of a higher form are every day making; and yet after all this, it cannot be denied but the ſeveral Bodies of the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> have behaved themſelves of late like Men, that underſtand too well the true Intereſt of the Proteſtant Religion, and of the Engliſh Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to ſacrifice the whole and themſelves in Concluſion to their private Reſentments: I hope the ſame Juſtice will be allowed me in ſtating the matter relating to the ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cried Perſecution ſet on by the Church of <hi>England;</hi> and that I may be ſuffered to diſtinguiſh the Heats of ſome angry and deluded Men, from the Doctrine of the Church, and the Practices that have been authorized in it; that ſo I may ſhew, that there is no reaſon to infer from paſt Errors, that we are incurable; or that new Opportunities inviting us again into the ſame Severities, are like to prevail over us to commit the ſame Follies over again. I will firſt ſtate what is paſt, with the Sincerity that becomes one that would not <hi>lie for God;</hi> that is not afraid nor aſhamed to confeſs Faults that will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aggravate nor extenuate them beyond what is juſt, and that yet will avoid the ſaying of any thing that may give any cauſe of Offence to any Party in the Nation.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. I am very ſorry that I muſt confeſs, that all the Parties among us, have ſhewed, that as their turn came to be upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, they have forgot the ſame Principles of Moderation and Liberty which they all claimed when they were oppreſſed. If it ſhould ſhew too much ill nature to examine what the <hi>Presbytery</hi> did in <hi>Scotland</hi> when the <hi>Covenant</hi> was in Dominion, or what the <hi>Independents</hi> have done in <hi>New-England;</hi> why may
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:101251:48"/> not I claim the ſame priviledg with relation to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> if Severities have been committed by her while ſhe bore Rule? yet it were as eaſy as it would be invidious to ſhew, that both <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and <hi>Independents</hi> have carried the Principle of Rigor in the point of Conſcience much higher, and have acted more implacably upon it than ever the Church of <hi>England</hi> has done, even in its angrieſt fits; ſo that none of them can much reproach another for their Exceſſes in thoſe matters. And as of all the <hi>Religions</hi> in the World the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is the moſt perſecuting, and the moſt bound by her Principles to be unalterably cruel; ſo the Church of <hi>England</hi> is the leaſt perſecuting in her Principles, and the leaſt obliged to repeat any Errors to which the Intrigues of Courts, or the Paſſions incident to all Parties may have engaged her, of any National Church in <hi>Europe.</hi> It cannot be ſaid to be any part of our Doctrine, when we came out of one of the blackeſt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions that is in Hiſtory, I mean Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s, we ſhewed how little we retained of the Cruelty of that Church, which had provoked us ſo ſeverely; when not only no Inquiries were made into the illegal Acts of Fury, that were committed in that perſecuting Reign, but even the Perſecutors themſelves lived among us at Eaſe and in Peace; and no <hi>Penal Law</hi> was made except againſt the publick Exerciſe of that Religion, till a great many Rebellions and Treaſons extorted them from us for our own Preſervation. This is an Inſtance of the Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency of our Church, that perhaps cannot be matched in Hiſtory: and why ſhould it not be ſuppoſed, that if God ſhould again put us in the ſtate in which we were of late, that we ſhould rather imitate ſo noble a Patern, than return to thoſe Miſtakes of which we are now aſhamed?</p>
            <p n="5">V. It is to be conſidered, that upon the late King's Reſtau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, the remembrance of the former War, the ill uſage that our Clergy had met with in their <hi>Sequeſtrations,</hi> the angry Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentments of the Cavalier Party, who were ruined by the War; the Intereſt of the Court to have all thoſe Principles condemned that had occaſioned it; the heat that all Parties that have been ill-uſed are apt to fall into upon a Revolution; but above all, the Practices of thoſe who have ſtill blown the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:101251:48"/> Coals, and ſet us one againſt another, that ſo they might not only have a divided Force to deal with, but might, by turns, make the Diviſions among us ſerve their Ends: All theſe, I ſay, concurred to make us loſe the happy Opportunity that was offered in the Year 1660, to have healed all our Diviſions, and to have triumphed over all the <hi>Diſſenters;</hi> not by ruining them, but by overcoming them with a Spirit of Love and Gentleneſs; which is the only Victory that a Generous and Chriſtian Temper can deſire. In ſhort, unhappy Counſels were followed, and ſevere Laws were made: But after all, it was the Court Party that carried it for rougher Methods. Some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Accidents, not neceſſary to be here mentioned, as they ſtopped the Mouths of ſome that had formed a wiſer Project, ſo they gave a fatal Advantage to angry and crafty Men, that to our misfortune, had too great a ſtroak in the conduct of our Affairs at that Time. This Spirit of Severity was height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Practices of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> who engaged the late King in <hi>December</hi> 1662, to give a Declaration for <hi>Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</hi> Thoſe who knew the Secret of his Religion, as they ſaw that it aimed at the Introduction of <hi>Popery,</hi> ſo they thought there was no way ſo effectual for the keeping out of <hi>Popery,</hi> as the maintaining the Uniformity, and the ſuppreſſing of all Deſigns for a Toleration. But while thoſe who managed this, uſed a due reſerve, in not diſcovering the ſecret Motive that led them to it; others flew into Severity, as the Principle in vogue: And thus all the ſlacknings of the rigour of the Laws, during the firſt <hi>Dutch</hi> War, that were ſet on upon the pretence of quieting the Nation, and of encouraging Trade, were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted by the Inſtruments of an honeſt <hi>Miniſter of State,</hi> who knew as well then, as we do now, what lay ſtill at bottom, when <hi>Liberty of Conſcience</hi> was pretended.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. Upon that Miniſter's Diſgrace, ſome that ſaw but the half of the Secret, perceiving in the Court a great inclination to Toleration, and being willing to take Meaſures quite different from thoſe of the former Miniſtry, they entred into a Treaty for a <hi>Comprehenſion of ſome Diſſenters, and the tolerating of others;</hi> And ſome Biſhops and Clergy-men, that were inferior to none of the Age in which they lived, for true Worth and a right
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:101251:49"/> Judgment of Things, engaged ſo far, and with ſo much ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs into this Project, that the Matter ſeemed done, all things being concerted among ſome of the moſt conſiderable Men of the different Parties. But the diſlike of that Miniſtry, and the Jealouſy of the ill Deſigns of the Court, gave ſo ſtrong a Prejudice againſt this, that the Propoſition could not be ſo much as hearkned to by the Houſe of Commons: And then it appeared how much the whole <hi>Popiſh Party</hi> was allarmed at the Project: It is well known with how much Deteſtation they ſpeak of it to this day; though we are now ſo fully ſatisfied of their Intentions to deſtroy us, that the Zeal which they pretended for us, in oppoſing that Deſign, can no more paſs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. At laſt, in the Year 1672. the Deſign for <hi>Popery</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering it ſelf, the End that the Court had in favouring a Toleration became more viſible: And when the Parliament met, that condemned the <hi>Declaration for Liberty of Conſcience,</hi> the Members of the Houſe of Commons, that either were Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, or that favoured them, behaved themſelves ſo worthily in concurring with thoſe of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> for ſtifling that Toleration, chuſing rather to loſe the benefit of it, than to open a Breach at which <hi>Popery</hi> ſhould come in, that many of the Members that were of the Church of <hi>England</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to procure them a Bill of <hi>Eaſe for Proteſtant Diſſenters.</hi> But the Seſſion was not long enough for bringing that to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; and all the Seſſions of that Parliament after that, were ſpent in ſuch a continual ſtruggle between the Court and Country-Party, that there was never room given for calm and wiſe Conſultations: yet though the Party of the Church of <hi>England</hi> did not perform what had been promiſed by ſome leading Men to the Diſſenters, there was little or nothing done againſt them, after that, till the Year 1681, ſo that for about nine Years together they had their Meetings almoſt as publickly and as regularly as the Church of <hi>England</hi> had their Churches, and in all that time, whatſoover parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Hardſhips any of them might have met with in ſome corners of <hi>England,</hi> it cannot be denied but they had the free Exerciſe of their Religion, at leaſt in moſt parts.</p>
            <pb n="89" facs="tcp:101251:49"/>
            <p n="8">VIII. In the Year 1678, things began to change their face: it is known that upon the breaking out of the <hi>Popiſh Plot,</hi> the Clergy did univerſally expreſs a great deſire for coming to ſome temper in the Points of Conformity: all ſorts and ranks of the Clergy ſeemed to be ſo well diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed towards it, that if it had met with a ſutable Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, matters might probably have been in a great meaſure compoſed. But the Jealouſy that thoſe who managed the Civil Concerns of the Nation in the Houſe of Commons, took off all that was done at Court, or propoſed by it, occaſioned a fatal Breach in our Publick Councils: in which diviſion, the Clergy by their Principles and Intereſts, and their Diſpoſition to believe well of the Court, were deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to be of the King's ſide. They thought it was a Sin to miſtruſt the late King's Word, who aſſured them of his ſteadineſs to the Proteſtant Religion ſo often, that they firmly depended on it: and his preſent Majeſty gave them ſo many Aſſurances of his maintaining ſtill the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that they believed him likewiſe: and ſo thought that the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of him from the Crown, was a degree of Rigor to which they in Conſcience could not conſent: upon which they were generally cried out on, as the Betrayers of the Nation and of the Proteſtant Religion: Thoſe who demanded the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, and ſome other Securities, to which the Biſhops would not conſent in Parliament, looked on them as the chief hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance that was in their way: and the Licenſe of the Preſs at that time was ſuch, that many Libels, and ſome ſevere Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes were publiſhed againſt them. Nor can it be denied, that many Church-men, who underſtood not the Principles of Human Society, and the Rules of our Government, ſo well as other Points of Divinity, writ ſeveral Treatiſes concerning the meaſures of Submiſſion, that were then as much cenſured, as their Performances ſince againſt <hi>Popery</hi> have been deſervedly admired. All this gave ſuch a Jealouſy of them to the Nation, that it muſt be confeſſed, that the Spirit which was then in fermentation went very high againſt the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as a Confederate at leaſt to <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Tyranny.</hi> Nor were ſeveral of the Nonconformiſts wanting to inflame this diſlike; all ſecret Propoſitions for accommodating our Differences were
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:101251:50"/> ſo coldly entertained, that they were ſcarce hearkned to. The Propoſitions which an Eminent Divine made even in his Books writ againſt Separation, ſhewed, that while we maintained the War in the way of Diſpute, yet we were ſtill willing to treat: for that great Man made not thoſe Advances towards them without conſulting with his Superiors. Yet we were then fatally given up to a Spirit of Diſſention: and tho the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in 1680 entred upon a project for healing our Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, in which great ſteps were made to the removing of all the occaſions of our Conteſt; the Leaders of the Diſſenters, to the amazement of all Perſons, made no account of this, and even ſeemed uneaſy at it, of which the Earl of <hi>Nottingham</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Clarges,</hi> that ſet on that Bill with much Zeal, can give a more particular account. All theſe things concurred to make thoſe of the Church of <hi>England</hi> conclude, a little too raſhly, that their Ruin was reſolved on; and then it was no wonder if the Spirit of a Party, the remembrance of the laſt Wars, the preſent proſpect of Danger, and above all, the great favour that was ſhewed them at Court, threw them into ſome angry and violent Counſels. Self-preſervation is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry natural: and it is plain, that many of them took that to be the caſe; ſo that truly ſpeaking, it was not ſo much at firſt a Spirit of Perſecution, as a deſire of diſabling thoſe who they believed intended to ruin them from effecting their Deſigns, that ſet them on to all thoſe unhappy things that followed. They were animated to all they did by the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued Earneſtneſs of the King and Duke, and their Miniſters. That Reproach of Juſtice and of the Profeſſion of the Law, who is now ſo high, was ſingled out for no other end, but to be their <hi>Common-Hangman</hi> over <hi>England:</hi> of whom the late King gave this true Character, <hi>That he had neither Wit, Law, nor Common Senſe; but that he had the Impudence of ten carted Whores in him.</hi> Another <hi>Buffoon</hi> was hired to plague the Nation with three or four Papers a Week; which to the Reproach of the Age, in which we live, had but too great and too general an effect, for poiſoning the Spirits of the Clergy. But thoſe who knew how all this was managed, ſaw that it was not only ſet on, but ſtill kept up by the Court. If any of the Clergy had put preached a word for Moderation, he had a chiding
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:101251:50"/> ſent him preſently from the Court; and he was from that day marked out as a <hi>diſaffected Perſon;</hi> and when the Clergy of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> did very worthily refuſe to give Informations againſt their Pariſhioners that had not always conformed, the deſign having been formed upon that to bring them into the <hi>Spiritual Courts,</hi> and excommunicate them, and make them loſe their Right of Voting, that ſo the Charter of <hi>London</hi> might have been delivered up when ſo many Citizens were by ſuch means ſhut out of the Common-Council. We remember well how ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they were cenſured for this, by ſome that are now dead, and others that are yet alive. I will not go further into this matter: I will not deny but many of the Diſſenters were put to great Hardſhips in many parts of <hi>England.</hi> I cannot deny it, and I am ſure I will never juſtify it. But this I will po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively ſay, having obſerved it all narrowly, that he muſt have the brow of a <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> that can caſt this wholly on the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and free the Court of it. The beginnings and the progreſs of it came from the Court, and from the Popiſh Party; and though perhaps every one does not know all the Secrets of this matter, that others may have found out, yet no Man was ſo ignorant as not to ſee what was the chief Spring of all thoſe irregular Motions that ſome of us made at that time: ſo upon the whole matter, all that can be made out of this, is, that the Paſſions and Infirmities of ſome of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> being unhappily ſtirred up by the Diſſenters, they were fatally conducted by the Popiſh Party, to be the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in doing a great deal of Miſchief.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. It is not to be doubted, but though ſome weaker Men of the Clergy may perhaps ſtill retain their little peeviſh Animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities againſt the Diſſenters; yet the wiſer and more ſerious Heads of that great and worthy Body, ſee now their Error; they ſee who drove them on in it, till they hoped to have ruined them by it. And as they have appeared againſt Popery, with as great a ſtrength of Learning and of firm Steadineſs as perhaps can be met with in all Church-Hiſtory, ſo it cannot be doubted, but their Reflections on the Dangers into which our Divſions have thrown us, have given them truer Notions with relation to a rigorous Conformity; and that the juſt Dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:101251:51"/> which they have expreſſed of the Corruptions of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> has led them to conſider and abhor one of the worſt things in it, I mean their <hi>Severity</hi> towards <hi>Hereticks.</hi> And the ill uſe that they ſee the Court has made of their Zeal for ſupporting the Crown, to juſtify the Subverſion of our Government that is now ſet on, from ſome of their large and unwary Expreſſions, will certainly make them hereafter more cautious in meddling with <hi>Politicks:</hi> the Biſhops have under their Hands both diſowned that wide extent of the <hi>Prerogative,</hi> to the overturning of the <hi>Law,</hi> and declared their Diſpoſition to come to a Temper in the matters of <hi>Conformity;</hi> and there ſeems to be no doubt left of the Sincerity of their Intentions in that matter. Their Piety and Vertue, and the proſpect that they now have of ſuffering themſelves, put us beyond all doubt as to their Sincerity; and if ever God in his Providence brings us again into a ſettled State, out of the Storm into which our Paſſions and Folly, as well as the Treachery of others, has brought us, it cannot be imagined that the Biſhops will go off from thoſe moderate Reſolutions which they have now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared: and they continuing firm to them, the weak and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcreet Paſſions of any of the Inferior Clergy muſt needs vaniſh, when they are under the Conduct of wiſe and worthy Leaders. And I will boldly ſay this, that if the Church of <hi>England,</hi> after ſhe has got out of this Storm, will return to hearken to the peeviſhneſs of ſome four Men, ſhe will be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned both of God and Man, and will ſet both Heaven and Earth againſt her. The Nation ſees too viſibly how dear the diſpute about <hi>Conformity</hi> has coſt us, to ſtand any more upon ſuch <hi>Punctilios;</hi> and <hi>Thoſe in whom our Deliverance is wrapt up,</hi> underſtand this matter too well, and judg too right of it, to imagine that ever they will be <hi>Prieſt-ridden</hi> in this point. So that all Conſiderations concur to make us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that there is no danger of our ſplitting a ſecond time upon the ſame Rock: and indeed, if any Argument were wanting to compleat the certainty of this Point, the wiſe and generous Behaviour of the main Body of the Diſſenters, in this preſent Juncture, has given them ſo juſt a Title to our Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, that we muſt reſolve to ſet all the World againſt us if we can ever forget it, and if we do not make them all the returns of Eaſe and Favour when it is in our Power to do it.</p>
            <pb n="93" facs="tcp:101251:51"/>
            <p n="10">X. It is to be hoped, that when this is laid together, it will have that effect on all ſober and true Proteſtants, as to make them forget the little angry Heats that have been among us, and even to forget the Injuries that have been done us: all that we do now one againſt another, is to ſhorten the work of our Enemies, by deſtroying one another, which muſt in Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion turn to all our Ruin. It is a mad Man's Revenge, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy our Friends that we may do a pleaſure to our Enemies, upon their giving us ſome good words; and if the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> can truſt to <hi>Papiſts,</hi> after the uſage that the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> has met with at their Hands, all the Comfort that they can promiſe themſelves, when <hi>Popery</hi> begins to act its natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral part among us, and to ſet <hi>Smithfield</hi> again in a Fire, is that which befell ſome <hi>Quakers</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> who were firſt put in the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> but were afterwards removed to <hi>Bedlam:</hi> ſo tho thoſe falſe Brethren among the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> who deceive them at preſent, are certainly no <hi>Changlings,</hi> but know well what they are doing; yet thoſe who can be cheated by them, may well claim the priviledg of a <hi>Bedlam,</hi> when their Folly has left them no other Retreat.</p>
            <p n="11">XI. I will not digreſs too far from my preſent purpoſe, nor enter into a diſcuſſion of the <hi>Diſpenſing Power,</hi> which was ſo effectually overthrown the other day at the <hi>King's Bench Bar,</hi> that I am ſure all the Authority of the <hi>Bench</hi> it ſelf is no more able to ſupport it: Yet ſome late Papers in favour of it, give me occaſion to add a little relating to that Point. It is true, the Aſſertor of the <hi>Diſpenſing Power,</hi> who has lately ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared <hi>with Allowance,</hi> pretends that it can only be applied to the <hi>Teſt</hi> for Publick Imployments: for he owns that the <hi>Teſt</hi> for both Houſes of Parliament, is left entire, as not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the compaſs of this extent of the Prerogative: But another Writer, whom by his Senſe we muſt conclude an <hi>Iriſh Man,</hi> by his Brow a <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> and by the bare deſignation in the Title Page, of <hi>James Stewart</hi>'s Letter, a <hi>Quaker,</hi> goes a ſtrain higher, and thinks the King is ſo abſolutely the Sovereign as to the Legiſlative part of our Government, that he may diſſolve even the <hi>Parliament Teſt:</hi> ſo nimbly has he leap'd from being a <hi>Secretary to a Rebellion,</hi> to be an <hi>Advocate for Tyranny.</hi> He
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:101251:52"/> fancies, that becauſe no Parliament can bind up another therefore they cannot limit the Preliminaries to a ſubſequen Parliament. But upon what is it then that Counties have but two Knights, and Burroughs as many; that Men below ſuch a value have no Vote; that Sheriffs only receive Writs and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn Elections, beſides many more neceſſary Requiſites to the making a legal Parliament? In ſhort, if Laws do not regulate the Election and Conſtitution of a Parliament, all theſe things may be overthrown, and the King may caſt the whole Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in a new Mould, as well as diſſolve the Obligation that is on the Members of Parliament for taking the <hi>Teſt.</hi> It is true, that as ſoon as a Parliament is legally met and conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted, it is tied by no Laws, ſo far as not to repeal them: But the Preliminaries to a Parliament are ſtill Sacred, as long as the Law ſtands that ſettled them; for the Members are ſtill in the quality of ordinary Subjects, and not entred upon their ſhare in the Legiſlative Power; till they are conſtituted in a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment legally choſen and lawfully aſſembled, that is, <hi>having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved all the Requiſites of the Law.</hi> But I leave that impudent <hi>Letter,</hi> to return to the moſt modeſt Apology that has been yet writ for the <hi>Diſpenſing Power.</hi> It yields that the King cannot <hi>abrogate</hi> Laws, and pretends only that he can diſpenſe with them: And the diſtinction it puts between <hi>Abrogation</hi> and <hi>Diſpenſation,</hi> is, that the one is a total Repeal of the Law, and that the other is only a ſlackning of its obligatory Force, with Relation to a particular Man, or to any Body of Men; ſo that according to him, a ſimple <hi>Abrogation,</hi> or a <hi>total Repeal,</hi> is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the compaſs of the Prerogative. I deſire then that this Doctrine may be applied to the following words of the <hi>Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;</hi> from which the Reader may infer, whether theſe do import a ſimple Abrogation, or not; and by Conſequence, if the Declaration is not Illegal; <q rend="inline">We do hereby further declare, that it is our <hi>Royal Will</hi> and <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> that the Oaths com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called the Oaths of Supremacy and Allegiance; and alſo the ſeveral Teſts and Declarations—ſhall not <hi>at any time hereafter,</hi> be required to be taken, declared, or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by <hi>any Perſon or Perſons whatſoever,</hi> who is or ſhall be imployed in any Office or Place of Truſt, either Civil or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary, under us, or in our Government.</q> This is plain <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:101251:52"/> and needs no Commentary. That Paper offers likewiſe an Expedient for ſecuring <hi>Liberty of Conſcience,</hi> by which it will be ſet beyond even the <hi>Diſpenſing Power;</hi> and that is, that by Act of Parliament all Perſecution may be declared to be a thing <hi>Evil in it ſelf,</hi> and then the Prerogative cannot reach it. But unleſs this Author fancies, that a Parliament is that which thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> believe a <hi>General Council</hi> to be, I mean, <hi>Infallible,</hi> I do not ſee that ſuch an Act would ſignify any thing at all. An Act of Parliament cannot change the Nature of Things which are ſullen, and will not alter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a hard Word is clap'd on them in an Act of Parliament; nor can that make that which is not <hi>Evil of it ſelf</hi> become <hi>Evil of ſelf:</hi> For can any Act of Parliament make the <hi>Clipping of Mony,</hi> or the not <hi>Burying in Wollen, evil of it ſelf?</hi> Such an Act were indeed <hi>null of it ſelf,</hi> and would ſink with its own weight, even without the burden of the Prerogative to preſs it down; and yet upon ſuch a Sandy Foundation would theſe Men have us build all our Hopes and our Securities. Another Topick like this, is, that we ought to truſt to the Truth of our <hi>Religion,</hi> and the Providence and Protection of God, and not lean ſo much to <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Teſts:</hi> All this were very perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, if God had not already given us humane Aſſurances a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Rage of our Enemies, which we are now deſired to abandon, that ſo we may fall an eaſy and cheap Sacrifice to thoſe who wait for the favourable Moment to deſtroy us. By the ſame Reaſon they may perſwade us to take off all our Doors, or at leaſt all our Locks and Bolts, and to ſleep in this expoſed Condition, truſting to God's Protection. The Simily may appear a little too high, though it is really ſhort of the Matter; for we had better truſt our ſelves to all the Thieves and Robbers of the Town, who would be perhaps contented with a part of our Goods, than to thoſe whoſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns are equally againſt both Soul and Body, and all that is dear to us.</p>
            <p n="12">XII. I will only add another Reflection upon the renewing of the <hi>Declaration</hi> this Year, which has occaſioned the preſent Storm upon the Clergy. It is repeated to us, that ſo we may ſee that the <hi>King</hi> continues firm to the Promiſes he made laſt
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:101251:53"/> Year. Yet when Men of Honour have once given their <hi>Word,</hi> they take it ill if any do not truſt to that, but muſt needs have it repeated to them. In the ordinary Commerce of the World, the repeating of Promiſes over and over again, is rather a ground of <hi>Suſpicion</hi> than of <hi>Confidence:</hi> and if we judg of the Accompliſhment of all the other parts of the <hi>Declaration,</hi> from that one which relates to the maintaining of the Church of <hi>England as by Law eſtabliſhed,</hi> the Proceedings againſt the <hi>Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows of Magdalen Colledg,</hi> gives us no reaſon to conclude, that this will be like <hi>the Laws of the</hi> Medes <hi>and</hi> Perſians, <hi>which alter not:</hi> all the talk of the New <hi>Magna Charta</hi> cannot lay us aſleep, when we ſee ſo little regard had to the <hi>Old one.</hi> As for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity which is offered us in this repeating of the <hi>King's</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, we muſt crave leave to remember, that the <hi>King of France,</hi> even after he had reſolved to break the <hi>Edict</hi> of <hi>Nantes,</hi> yet repeated in above an hundred <hi>Edicts,</hi> that were real and viſible Violations of that <hi>Edict,</hi> a Clauſe confirmatory of the <hi>Edict of Nantes,</hi> declaring that he would never <hi>Violate</hi> it: and in that we may ſee what Account is to be had of all <hi>Promiſes</hi> made to <hi>Hereticks</hi> in Matters Religion, by any Prince of the Roman Communion, but more particularly by a <hi>Prince</hi> who has put the conduct of his <hi>Conſcience</hi> in the Hands of a <hi>Jeſuite.</hi>

               <hi>Some EXTRACTS out of Mr. JAMES STEWART's LETTERS,</hi> Which were Communicated to <hi>Mijn Heer FAGAL,</hi> the States <hi>Penſioner</hi> of the Province of <hi>Holland.</hi> Together with ſome References to Maſter <hi>STEWART</hi>'s Printed Letter.</head>
            <p>MR. <hi>Stewart</hi> ſtaid about ſeven Months, after he had received the <hi>Penſionary</hi>'s <hi>Letter,</hi> before he thought fit to write any <hi>Anſwer</hi> to it: and then inſtead of ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one in writing to the <hi>Penſioner,</hi> or in a Language under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by him, he has thought fit, by a Civility peculiar to himſelf, to print an Anſwer in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and to ſend it abroad into the World, before the <hi>Penſioner</hi> had ſo much as ſeen it. The many and great Affairs that preſs hard upon that Eminent Miniſter, together with a ſad want of Health, by which he has been long afflicted, have made, that he had not the leiſure to procure Mr. <hi>Stewart's</hi> Letter to be tranſlated to him, and to compare the Matters of Fact related to in it, with the Letters that were writ the laſt Year by Mr. <hi>Stewart,</hi> which are in his
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:101251:54"/> poſſeſſion; nor did he think it Neceſſary to make too much haſt: and therefore if he has let as many <hi>weeks</hi> paſs, without ordering an <hi>Anſwer</hi> to be prepared, as the other had done <hi>Months,</hi> he thought that even this ſlowneſs, might look like one that deſpiſed this indecent Attempt upon his Honour, that Mr. <hi>Stewart</hi> has made in giving ſo unjuſt a repreſentation of the Matter of Fact. He hopes he is too well known to the World, to apprehend that any Perſons would entertain the hard thoughts of him, which Mr. <hi>Stewart's</hi> late Print may have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to them; and therefore he has proceeded in this Matter, with the ſlowneſs that he thought became his Integrity, ſince a greater haſte might have look'd like one that was uneaſy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he knew himſelf to be in Fault. As for the reaſoning part of Mr. <hi>Stewart's Paper,</hi> he has already expreſſed himſelf in his Letter to Mr. <hi>d' Albeville,</hi> that he will not enter into any arguing upon thoſe Points, but will leave the Matter to the Judgment of every Reader; therefore he has given order only to examin thoſe Matters of Fact, that are ſet forth in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Mr. <hi>Stewart's Letter,</hi> that ſo the World may have a true account of the Motives that induced him to write his <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> to Mr. <hi>Stewart,</hi> from the words of Mr. <hi>Stewart</hi>'s own <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters:</hi> and then he will leave it to the Judgment of every Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, whether Mr. <hi>Stewart</hi> has given the Matter of Fact fairly or not. It is true, the <hi>Penſioner</hi> has not thought fit to print all Mr. <hi>Stewart</hi>'s <hi>Letters,</hi> at their full length; there are many Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars in them for which he is not willing to expoſe him: and in this he has ſhewed a greater regard to Mr. <hi>Stewart,</hi> than the uſage that he has met with from him deſerves: If Mr. <hi>Stewart</hi> has kept Copies of his own <hi>Letters,</hi> he muſt ſee that the <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioner's</hi> reſervedneſs is rather grounded on what he thought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came himſelf, than on what Mr. <hi>Stewart</hi> has deſerved of him. But if Mr. <hi>Stewart,</hi> or any in his Name, will take Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges from this, that the <hi>Letters</hi> themſelves are not publiſhed, and that here there are only <hi>Extracts</hi> of them offered to the World, then the <hi>Penſioner</hi> will be excuſed, if he prints them all to a Tittle. The Truth is, it is ſcarce conceivable how Mr. <hi>Stewart</hi> could aſſume the confidence that appears in his printed Letter, if he have kept Copies of the Letters that he writ laſt Year: and if he engaged himſelf in Affairs of ſuch Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:101251:54"/> without keeping Copies of what he writ, it was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what extraordinary; and yet this cenſure is that which falls the ſofteſt on him: but I will avoid every thing that looks like a ſharpneſs of Expreſſion; for the <hi>Penſioner</hi> expects, that he who is to give this Account to the <hi>Engliſh Nation,</hi> ſhould rather conſider the Dignity of the <hi>Poſt</hi> in which he is, than the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages that Mr. <hi>Stewart</hi> may have given for replying ſharply on him. And in this whole Matter the <hi>Penſioner's</hi> chief concern is, to offer to the World ſuch a Relation of the Occaſions that drew his <hi>Letter</hi> to Mr. <hi>Stewart</hi> from him, as may juſtify him againſt the falſe Inſinuations that are given: he owed this like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, as an expreſſion of his Reſpect and Duty to their High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, in whoſe Name he wrote his <hi>Letter,</hi> and at whom all thoſe falſe Repreſentations are levelled, tho they fall firſt and immediately upon himſelf.</p>
            <p>The ſum of the Matter of Fact, as it is repreſented by Mr. <hi>Stewart,</hi> amounts to this, <q rend="inline">That he was ſo ſurpriſed to ſee, in <hi>January</hi> laſt, the <hi>Penſioner's</hi> Letter to him in print, that he was inclined to disbelieve his own Eyes, conſidering the remoteneſs of the occaſion that was given for that <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:</hi> that he had never writ to the <hi>Penſioner,</hi> but was expreſly <hi>cautioned againſt it.</hi> But that ſeeing the ſincerity of the King's Intentions, he was deſirous to contribute his ſmall endeavours for the advancing ſo good a Work, and for that end he <hi>Obtained Leave</hi> to write to a private Friend, who he judged might have opportunity to repreſent any thing he could ſay to the beſt advantage; but that of the <hi>Letters</hi> which he writ to his Friend, there were only two intended for communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in which he ſtudied to evince the Equity and Expediency, of repealing the <hi>Teſts</hi> and the <hi>Penal Laws:</hi> and that with a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar regard to the <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Princeſs</hi> of <hi>Orange's</hi> Intereſt; and he deſired that this might be Imparted to Friends, but chiefly to thoſe at the <hi>Hague.</hi> And that this was the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of all that he writ on that occaſion. But finding that the Prince had already declared himſelf in thoſe Matters, he reſolved to inſiſt no further: yet his Friend inſinuating, that he had ſtill hopes to get a more diſtinct and ſatisfying <hi>Anſwer,</hi> from a better hand, though without naming the Perſon, he attended the Iſſue; and about the beginning of <hi>November,</hi> almoſt three moneths after his firſt writing, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:101251:55"/> the <hi>Penſioner's Letter,</hi> though he had not writ to him (which is repeated again and again) and in it an account of the <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Princeſs</hi> of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Thoughts about the <hi>Repeal of the Teſts and Penal Laws</hi> (which he had not deſired) upon which he took ſome care to prevent the publiſhing of it: But when he ſaw it in print, he clearly perceived that it was printed in <hi>Holland;</hi> and ſo wonders how the <hi>Penſioner</hi> could ſay, that it was printed in <hi>England,</hi> which he found in his printed Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to Mr. <hi>d' Albeville.</hi> He knows not upon what Provocation the <hi>Penſioner</hi> writ that <hi>Letter:</hi> but in it he finds that he writ, that he was deſired by himſelf <hi>to give him an account of the Prince and Princeſs of Orange's Thoughts,</hi> and that theſe preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Deſires were made to him by His Majeſtie's Knowledg and Allowance: this being ſo different from the <hi>Letters</hi> he had writ, of which he is ſure that the account he has given is true in every point, he was forced to vindicate the King's Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and his own Duty. He writ not out of any curioſity to know their Highneſſes Thoughts, which were already known, they having been ſignified to the <hi>Marquis of Albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi> and therefore he had no Orders from the King for wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on that Subject, but only a Permiſſion to uſe his little Endeavors for the advancing of his Service; but it was never moved to him to write, either in the King's Name, or in the Name of any of his Secretaries.</q> This is Mr. <hi>Stewart's</hi> Account in the firſt nine Pages of his <hi>Letter,</hi> and is ſet down in his own words.</p>
            <p>Now in oppoſition to all this, it will appear from the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>Extracts,</hi> that Mr. <hi>Stewart</hi> writ to his Friend, as the moſt proper Interpreter for addreſſing himſelf to the <hi>Penſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:</hi> that he repeated his Propoſition frequently, finding his Friend unwilling to engage in ſo Critical a matter. He gives great Aſſurances of His <hi>Majeſties</hi> Reſolutions <hi>never to alter the Succeſſion,</hi> (which is plainly the Language of a Treaty) he preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes over and over again to know the <hi>Prince</hi>'s Mind, whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence in the Matter would be the beſt <hi>Guarentee</hi> of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. He, by Name, deſires his <hi>Letters</hi> may be ſhewed to the <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Princeſs</hi> of <hi>Orange</hi> (though he ſays, he only ordered them to be ſhewed to <hi>Friends at the Hague:</hi> ſo it ſeems he has the modeſty to reckon them among the number of his <hi>Friends;</hi> but it is a queſtion whether their <hi>Highneſſes</hi> do ſo or
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:101251:55"/> not) he ſays in one <hi>Letter, That what he writ was from his Majeſty himſelf,</hi> and enlarges more fully on this in two other <hi>Letters;</hi> and he deſires, that the <hi>Princes Anſwers, with his Reaſons, might be underſtood;</hi> which very probably gave the occaſion to all the reaſoning part of the <hi>Penſioner's Letter:</hi> and it appears by that <hi>Letter,</hi> that the <hi>Return</hi> to all this was expected by the <hi>King,</hi> and in almoſt every <hi>Letter</hi> he preſſes for a Return.</p>
            <p>And in Concluſion, upon his receiving the <hi>Penſioner's Letter,</hi> he expreſſes likewiſe a great ſenſe of the Honour done him in it: that he had ſo far complied with his Inſignificant Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours; he mentions his acquainting both the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Earls</hi> of <hi>Sunderland</hi> and <hi>Melfort</hi> with it; and in another <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> after new Thanks for the <hi>Penſioner's Letter,</hi> he <hi>laments that it was ſo long delayed.</hi> But all theſe things will appear more evident to the <hi>Reader,</hi> from the Paſſages drawn out of Mr. <hi>Stewart's</hi> own <hi>Letters,</hi> which follow. Mr. <hi>Stewart</hi> ſeems not to know upon what provocation the <hi>Penſioner</hi> writ to Mr. <hi>d' Albeville,</hi> and yet the <hi>Penſioner</hi> had ſet that forth in the <hi>Letter</hi> it ſelf; for the Pamphlet entituled <hi>Parliamentum Pacificum,</hi> that was licenſed by the Earl of <hi>Sunderland,</hi> contained ſuch Reflections on his <hi>Letter</hi> to Mr. <hi>Stewart,</hi> either as a <hi>Forgery, or as a thing done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Princeſs of Orange's knowledg,</hi> that the <hi>Penſioner</hi> judged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf bound in honour to do himſelf right. As for Mr. <hi>Stewart's</hi> criticalneſs, in knowing that the <hi>Penſioner's Letter</hi> was firſt print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Holland,</hi> and his Reflection on the <hi>Penſioner</hi> for inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that the <hi>Letter</hi> was firſt printed in <hi>England;</hi> it is very like that Mr. <hi>Stewart,</hi> after ſo long a practice in Libels, knows how to diſtinguiſh between the Prints of the ſeveral Nations better than the <hi>Penſioner,</hi> whoſe courſe of Life has raiſed him above all ſuch Practices. But it is certain, that whereſoever it was firſt printed, the <hi>Penſioner</hi> writ ſincerely, and believed really that it was firſt printed in <hi>England.</hi> This is all that ſeemed neceſſary to be ſaid for an Introduction to the following <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts.</hi>

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:101251:57"/> which I aſſure you was writ, not only with permiſſion, but according to his Majeſty</hi>'s Mind <hi>ſufficiently expreſſed; our Religion ought cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly to be dearer to us than all Earthly Concerns. It is very true what you ſay, that Miſtakes about its Concerns (eſpecially in ſuch a time) may be of the greateſt Importance,</hi> which no doubt ſhould perſwade to a very ſcrupulous caution: But yet I am ſatisfied, <hi>that the ſimple repreſenting of what was wrote to you (which was all I required) was no ſuch difficult Task</hi> — But to be plain with you, as my Friend, your return was not only long delay'd, but I obſerve ſuch a Coldneſs in it, different from the ſtrain of your former, that I think I miſtake not when I underſtand by your Letter more than you expreſs — <hi>I wiſh the P. may ſee or hear this from end to end.</hi>

               <head>THE CONCLUSION.</head>
               <p>AND thus all that relates to the Occaſion that drew the <hi>Penſioner's Letter</hi> from him, appears in its true Light. If this Diſcovery is uneaſy to Mr. <hi>Stewart,</hi> he has none to blame for it but himfelf. It it very likely the firſt Article of his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, for the defacing of all that was paſt, was the pains he took to work on their <hi>Highneſſes,</hi> by the <hi>Penſioner</hi>'s Means: But that having failed him, the abuſive <hi>Letter</hi> that he has pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed upon it, may come in for a ſecond Article: And now the Reproaches to which this Diſcovery muſt needs expoſe
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:101251:59"/> him, muſt compleat his Merit: if upon all this he is not highly rewarded, he has ill Luck, and ſmall Encouragement will be given to others to ſerve the <hi>Court</hi> as he has done. But if he has great Rewards, it muſt be acknowledged, that he has paid dear for them. The printing and diſtributing 15000 Copies of his <hi>Letter,</hi> is only the publiſhing his ſhame to 15000 Perſons, though it is to be doubted, if ſo many could be found in the Nation, who would give themſelves the trouble to read ſo ill a Paper.</p>

            <head>AN ENQUIRY Into the Meaſures of SUBMISSION TO THE SUPREAM AUTHORITY: <hi>And of the</hi> Grounds <hi>upon which it may be</hi> lawful <hi>or neceſſary for</hi> Subjects <hi>to defend their</hi> Religion, Lives, <hi>and</hi> Liberties.</head>
            <p>THis <hi>Enquiry</hi> cannot be regularly made, but by taking in the firſt place, a true and full view of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>Civil Society,</hi> and more particularly of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>Supream Power,</hi> whether it is lodged in one or more Perſons?</p>
            <p n="1">I. It is certain, That the <hi>Law of Nature</hi> has put no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence nor ſubordination among Men, except it be that of <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi> to <hi>Parents,</hi> or of <hi>Wives</hi> to their <hi>Husbands;</hi> ſo that with Relation to the Law of Nature, all Men are born free; and this Liberty muſt ſtill be ſuppoſed entire, unleſs ſo far as it is limited by Contracts, Proviſions, or Laws. For a Man can either bind himſelf to be a Servant, or ſell himſelf to be a Slave, by which he becomes in the power of another, only ſo far as it was provided by the Contract: ſince all that Liberty which was not expreſly given away, remains ſtill entire: ſo that the Plea for Liberty always proves it ſelf, unleſs it appears that it is given up or limited by any ſpecial Agreement.</p>
            <pb n="120" facs="tcp:101251:65"/>
            <p n="2">II. It is no leſs certain, that as the Light of Nature has planted in all Men a Natural Principle of the love of Life, and of a deſire to preſerve it; ſo the common Principles of all Religion agree in this, that God having ſet us in this World, we are bound to preſerve that Being, which he has given us, by all juſt and lawful ways. Now this Duty of Self-preſervation is exerted in Inſtances of two ſorts; the one are, in the reſiſting of violent Aggreſſors; the other are the taking of juſt Revenges of thoſe, who have invaded us ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly, that we could not prevent them, and ſo violently that we could not reſiſt-them: In which caſes the Principle of ſelf-Preſervation warrants us, both to recover what is our own, with juſt Damages, and alſo to put ſuch unjuſt Perſons out of a Capacity of doing the like Injuries any more, either to our ſelves, or to any others. Now in theſe two Inſtances of Self-Preſervation, this difference is to be obſerved; that the firſt cannot be limited by any ſlow Forms, ſince a preſſing Danger re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a vigorous Repulſe, and cannot admit of Delays; whereas the ſecond, of taking Revenges, or Reparations, is not of ſuch haſte, but that it may be brought under Rules and Forms.</p>
            <p n="3">III. The true and Original Notion of <hi>Civil Society</hi> and <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> is, that it is a Compromiſe made by ſuch a Body of Men, by which they reſign up the Right of demanding Repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, either in the way of Juſtice againſt one another, or in the way of War, againſt their Neighbours; to ſuch a ſingle Perſon, or to ſuch a Body of Men as they think fit to truſt with this. And in the management of this <hi>Civil Society,</hi> great diſtinction is to be made, between the Power of making Laws for the regulating the Conduct of it, and the Power of executing thoſe Laws: The <hi>Supream Authority</hi> muſt ſtill be ſuppoſed to be lodged with thoſe who have the <hi>Legiſlative Power</hi> reſerved to them, but not with thoſe who have only the <hi>Executive;</hi> which is plainly a <hi>Truſt,</hi> when it is ſeparated from the <hi>Legiſlative Power;</hi> and all <hi>Truſts,</hi> by their nature import, that thoſe to whom they are given, are accountable, even though that it ſhould not be expreſly ſpecified in the words of the <hi>Truſt</hi> it ſelf.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. It cannot be ſuppoſed, by the Principles of Natural Religion, that God has authoriſed any one <hi>Form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:101251:65"/> any other way than as the general Rules of Order, and of Juſtice, oblige all Men not to ſubvert Conſtitutions, nor diſturb the Peace of Mankind, or invade thoſe Rights with which the Law may have veſted ſome Perſons: for it is certain, that as private Contracts lodg or tranſlate private Rights; ſo the <hi>Publick Laws</hi> can likewiſe lodg ſuch Rights, Prerogatives and Revenues in thoſe under whoſe Protection they put themſelves, and in ſuch a manner, that they may come to have as good a Title to theſe, as any private Perſon can have to his Property: ſo that it becomes an Act of high Injuſtice and Violence to invade theſe: which is ſo far a greater Sin than any ſuch Actions would be againſt a private Perſon, as the publick Peace and Order is preferrable to all private Conſiderations whatſoever. So that in Truth, the Principles of <hi>Natural Religion,</hi> give thoſe that are in Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty no Power at all, but they do only ſecure them in the Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that which is theirs by Law. And as no Conſiderations of Religion can bind me to pay another more than I indeed owe him, but do only bind me more ſtrictly to pay what I owe; ſo the Conſiderations of Religion do indeed bring <hi>Subjects</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſtricter Obligations to pay all due Allegiance and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to their <hi>Princes,</hi> but they do not at all extend that Allegiance further than the Law carries it. And though a Man has no Divine Right to his Property, but has acquired it by human means, ſuch as Succeſſion, or Induſtry; yet he has a Security for the Enjoyment of it from a Divine Right: ſo tho <hi>Princes</hi> have no immediate Warrants from Heaven, either for their Original Titles, or for the extent of them, yet they are ſecured in the Poſſeſſion of them by the Principles and Rules of <hi>Natural Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">V. It is to be conſidered, that as a private Perſon can bind himſelf to another Man's Service, by different degrees, either as an ordinary Servant for Wages, or as one appropriate for a longer time, as an Apprentice; or by a total giving himſelf up to another, as in the caſe of Slavery: in all which caſes the general Name of <hi>Maſter</hi> may be equally uſed, yet the degrees of his Power, are to be judged by the nature of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract: ſo likewiſe Bodies of Men can give themſelves up in different degrees to the Conduct of others: and therefore
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:101251:66"/> though all thoſe may carry the ſame Name of <hi>King,</hi> yet every ones Power is to be taken from the meaſures of that Authority which is lodged in him, and not from any general Speculations founded on ſome Equivocal Terms, ſuch as <hi>King, Sovereign,</hi> or <hi>Sapream.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">VI. It is certain, that God, as the Creator and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the World, may ſet up whom he will to rule over other Men: But this Declaration of his Will muſt be made evident by Prophets, or other extraordinary Men ſent of him, who have ſome manifeſt Proofs of the Divine Authority that is committed to them on ſuch occaſions, and upon ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons declaring the Will of God in favour of any others, that Declaration is to be ſubmitted to and obeyed. But this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of a Divine Delegation, can be carried no further than to thoſe who are thus expreſly marked out, and is unjuſtly claimed by thoſe who can prove no ſuch Declaration to have been ever made in favour of them, or their Families. Not does it appear reaſonable to conclude from their being in Poſſeſſion, that it is the Will of God that it ſhould be ſo, this juſtifies all Uſurpers when they are ſucceſsful.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. The meaſures of <hi>Power,</hi> and by conſequence of <hi>Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> muſt be taken from the expreſs Laws of any State or Body of Men, from the Oaths that they ſwear, or from imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial Preſcription, and a long Poſſeſſion, which both give a Title, and in a long Tract of Time make a bad one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came good, ſince Preſcription, when it paſſes the Memory of Man, and is not diſputed by any other Pretender, gives by the common Senſe of all Men a juſt and good Title: ſo upon the whole matter, the degrees of all Civil Authority are to be taken either from expreſs Laws, immemorial Cuſtoms, or from particular Oaths, which the Subjects ſwear to their Princes: this being ſtill to be laid down for a Principle, that in all the Diſputes between <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Liberty, Power</hi> muſt always be proved, but <hi>Liberty</hi> proves it ſelf; the one being founded only upon a Poſitive Law, and the other upon the Law of Nature.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. If from the general Principles of Human Society, and Natural Religion, we carry this matter to be examined by the Scriptures, it is clear that all the Paſſages that are in the Old Teſtament, are not to be made uſe of in this matter of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:101251:66"/> ſide. For as the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was given to the <hi>Jews</hi> by an immediate Grant from Heaven; ſo God reſerved ſtill this to himſelf, and to the Declarations that he ſhould make from time to time, either by his Prophets, or by the Anſwers that came from the Cloud of Glory that was between the Cherubims, to ſet up Judges or Kings over them, and to pull them down again as he thought fit. Here was an expreſs De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legation made by God, and therefore all that was done in that Diſpenſation, either for or againſt Princes, is not to be made uſe of in any other State that is founded on another Bottom and Conſtitution, and all the Expreſſions in the Old Teſtament relating to <hi>Kings,</hi> ſince they belong to Perſons that were immediately deſigned by God, are without any ſort of Reaſon applied to thoſe who can pretend to no ſuch Deſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, neither for themſelves, nor for their Anceſtors.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. As for the New Teſtament, it is plain, that there are no Rules given in it, neither for the <hi>Forms of Government</hi> in general, nor for the degrees of any one Form in particular, but the general Rules of Juſtice, Order and Peace, being eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in it upon higher Motives, and more binding Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, than ever they were in any other Religion what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, we are moſt ſtrictly bound by it to obſerve the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution in which we are; and it is plain, that the Rules ſer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ve in the Goſpel can be carried no further. It is indeed clear from the New Teſtament, that the Chriſtian Religion as ſuch, gives us no grounds to defend or propagate it by force. It is a Doctrine of the Croſs, and of Faith, and Patience under it: And if by the order of Divine Providence, and of any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Government, under which we are born, we are brought under Sufferings for our profeſſing of it, we may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed retire and fly out of any ſuch Country if we can; but if that is denied us, we muſt then, according to this Religion, ſubmit to thoſe Sufferings under which we may be brought, conſidering that God will be glorified by us in ſo doing, and that he will both ſupport us under our Suffering, and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly reward us for them.</p>
            <p>This was the State of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> during the three firſt <hi>Centuries,</hi> under Heathen <hi>Emperors,</hi> and a Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in which <hi>Paganiſm</hi> was eſtabliſh'd by Law. But if by the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:101251:67"/> Laws of any Government, the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> or any Form of it, is become a part of the Subjects <hi>Property,</hi> it then falls under another Conſideration; not as it is a <hi>Religion,</hi> but as it is become one of the principal Rights of the Subjects to believe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs it: and then we muſt judg of the Invaſions made on that, as we do of any other Invaſion that is made on our other <hi>Rights.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">X. All the Paſſages in the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> that relate to <hi>Civil Government,</hi> are to be expounded as they were truly meant, in oppoſition to that falſe Notion of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who believed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be ſo immediately under the Divine Authority, that they could not become the Subjects of any other Power, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly of one that was not of their Nation, or of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; therefore they thought they could not be under the <hi>Roman</hi> Yoke, nor bound to pay Tribute to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> but judged that they were only ſubject out of <hi>Fear,</hi> by reaſon of the Force that lay on them, but not for <hi>Conſcience ſake:</hi> And ſo in all their Diſperſion, both at <hi>Rome</hi> and elſewhere, they thought they were <hi>God's Freemen,</hi> and made uſe of this pretended <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty as a Cloak of Maliciouſneſs.</hi> In oppoſition to all which, ſince in a courſe of many Years, they had asked the Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Roman</hi> Yoke, and were come under their Authority, our Saviour ordered them to continue in that, by his ſaying, <hi>Render to</hi> Ceſar <hi>that which is</hi> Ceſar<hi>'s;</hi> and both St. <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and St. <hi>Peter</hi> in his general <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> have very poſitively condemned that pernicious Maxim, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any formal Declarations made of the Rules or Meaſures of <hi>Government.</hi> And ſince both the <hi>People</hi> and <hi>Senate</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> had acknowledged the Power that <hi>Auguſtus</hi> had indeed violently uſurped, it became Legal when it was thus ſubmitted to, and confirmed both by the <hi>Senate</hi> and <hi>People:</hi> and it was eſtabliſhed in his Family by a long Preſcription, when thoſe <hi>Epiſtles</hi> were writ: So that upon the whole matter, all that is in the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> upon this Subject, imports no more, but that <hi>all Chriſtians</hi> are bound to acquieſce in the <hi>Government,</hi> and ſubmit to it, according to the Conſtitution that is ſetled by <hi>Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="11">XI. We are then at laſt brought to the Conſtitution of our Engliſh Government: So that no general Conſiderations from Speculations about Soveraign Power, nor from any Paſſages, either of the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> ought to determine us
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:101251:67"/> in this Matter; which muſt be fixed from the Laws and Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations that have been made among us. It is then certain, that with Relation to the Executive part of the Government, the Law has lodged that ſingly in the King; ſo that the whole Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of it is in him; but the Legiſlative Power is lodged between the King and the two Houſes of Parliament; ſo that the Power of making and repealing Laws, is not ſingly in the King, but only ſo far as the two Houſes concur with him. It is alſo clear, that the King has ſuch a determined extent of Prerogative, beyond which he has no Authority: As for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, If he levies Mony of his People, without a Law im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powring him to it, he goes beyond the Limits of his Power, and asks that to which he has no Right: So that there lies no Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation on the Subject to grant it; and if any in his Name uſe Violence for the obtaining it, they are to be looked on as ſo many Robbers, that invade our Property; and they being vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Aggreſſors, the Principle of Self-Preſervation ſeems here to take place, and to warrant as violent a Reſiſtance.</p>
            <p n="12">XII. There is nothing more evident, than that <hi>England</hi> is a Free Nation, that has its Libertits and Properties reſerved to it by many poſitive and expreſs Laws: If then we have a Right to our Property, we muſt likewiſe be ſuppoſed to have a Right to preſerve it: for thoſe Rights are by the Law ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red againſt the Invaſions of the Prerogative, and by conſequence we muſt have a Right to preſerve them againſt thoſe Invaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. It is alſo evidently declared by our Law, that all Orders and Warrants that are iſſued out in oppoſition to them, are null of themſelves; and by conſequence, any that pretend to have Commiſſions from the King for thoſe Ends, are to be conſidered as if they had none at all; ſince thoſe Commiſſions being void of themſelves, are indeed no Commiſſions in the Conſtruction of the Law; and therefore thoſe who act in virtue of them, are ſtill to be conſidered as private Perſons who come to invade and diſturb us. It is alſo to be obſerved, that there are ſome Points that are juſtly diſputable and doubtful, and others that are ſo manifeſt, that it is plain that any Objections that can be made to them, are rather forced Pretences, than ſo much as plauſible Colours. It is true, if the Caſe is doubtful, the Intereſt of the publick Peace and Order ought to carry it; but the Caſe
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:101251:68"/> is quite different, when the Invaſions that are made upon <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Property,</hi> are plain and viſible to all that conſider them.</p>
            <p n="13">XIII. The main and great Difficulty here, is, that though our Government does indeed aſſert the <hi>Liberty of the Subject,</hi> yet there are many expreſs Laws made, that lodg the <hi>Militia</hi> ſingly in the King, that make it plainly unlawful, upon any Pretence whatſoever, to take Arms againſt the King, or any Commiſſioned by him: And theſe Laws have been put in the Form of an Oath, which all that have born any Employment, either in Church or State, have ſworn; and therefore thoſe Laws for the aſſuring our <hi>Liberties,</hi> do indeed bind the King's Conſcience, and may affect his Miniſters; yet ſince it is a Maxime of our Law, that the <hi>King can do no Wrong,</hi> theſe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be carried ſo far as to juſtify our taking Arms againſt him, be the Tranſgreſſions of Laws ever ſo many and ſo manifeſt. And ſince this has been the conſtant Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> it will be a very heavy Imputation on us, if it appears, that though we held thoſe Opinions, as long as the Court and Crown have favoured us, yet as ſoon as the Court turns againſt us, we change our Principles.</p>
            <p n="14">XIV. Here is the true Difficulty of this whole Matter, and therefore it ought to be exactly conſidered: 1. All general Words how large ſoever, are ſtill ſuppoſed to have a tacit Exception and Reſerve in them, if the Matter ſeems to require it. Children are commanded to obey their Parents in <hi>all things:</hi> Wives are declared by the Scripture, to be ſubject to their Husband <hi>in all things, as the Church is unto Chriſt:</hi> And yet how comprehenſive ſoever theſe words may ſeem to be, there is ſtill a Reſerve to be underſtood in them; and though by our Form of Marriage, the Parties ſwear to one another <hi>till Death them do part,</hi> yet few doubt but that this Bond is diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by Adultery, though it is not named: for odious things ought not to be ſuſpected, and therefore not named upon ſuch occaſions: But when they fall out, they carry ſtill their own force with them. 2. When there ſems to be a Contradiction between two Articles in the Conſtitution, we ought to examine which of the two is the moſt Evident, and the moſt Important, and ſo we ought to fix upon it, and then we muſt give ſuch an accommodating ſenſe to that which ſeems to contradict it, that
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:101251:68"/> ſo we may reconcile thoſe together. Here then are two ſeeming Contradictions in our Conſtitution; The one is the Publick Liberty of the Nation; the other is the renouncing of all Reſiſtance, in caſe that were invaded. It is plain, that our Liberty is only a thing that we enjoy at the King's Diſcretion, and during his Pleaſure, if the other againſt all Reſiſtance is to be underſtood according to the utmoſt Extent of the Words. Therefore ſince the chief Deſign of our whole Law, and of all the ſeveral Rules of our Conſtitution, is to ſecure and maintain our Liberty, we ought to lay that down for a Concluſion, that it is both the moſt plain, and the moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant of the two. And therefore the other Article againſt <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance</hi> ought to be ſo ſoftned, as that it do not deſtroy us. 3. Since it is by a Law that Reſiſtance is condemned, we ought to underſtand it in ſuch a ſenſe, as that it does not deſtroy all other Laws: And therefore the intent of this <hi>Law</hi> muſt only relate to the <hi>Executive</hi> Power, which is in the King, and not to the <hi>Legiſlative,</hi> in which we cannot ſuppoſe that our Legiſlators, who made that <hi>Law,</hi> intended to give up that, which we plainly ſee they reſolved ſtill to preſerve entire, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Ancient Conſtitution. So then, the not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting the King, can only be applied to the <hi>Executive</hi> Power, that ſo upon no pretence of ill Adminiſtrations in the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the Law, it ſhould be lawful to reſiſt him; but this cannot with any reaſon be extended to an Invaſion of the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative</hi> Power, or to a total Subverſion of the Government. For it being plain, that the <hi>Law</hi> did not deſign to lodg that Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in the King; it is alſo plain, that it did not intend to ſecure him in it, in caſe he ſhould ſet about it. 4. The <hi>Law</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning the King, or thoſe Commiſſioned by him, ſhews plainly, that it only deſigned to ſecure the King in the Executive Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: for the word Commiſſion neceſſarily importts this, ſince if it is not according to <hi>Law,</hi> it is no Commiſſion; and by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, thoſe who act in virtue of it, are not Commiſſiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the King in the Senſe of the <hi>Law.</hi> The King likewiſe imports a Prince clothed by <hi>Law</hi> with the Regal Prerogative; but if he goes to ſubvert the whole Foundation of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, he ſubverts that by which he himſelf has his Power, and by conſequence he annuls his own Power; and then he
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:101251:69"/> ceaſes to be <hi>King,</hi> having endeavoured to deſtroy that upon which his own Authority is founded.</p>
            <p n="15">XV. It is acknowledged by the greateſt Aſſertors of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchial Power, that in ſome Caſes a <hi>King</hi> may fall from his Power, and in other Caſes that he may fall from the Exerciſe of it. His Deſerting his People, his going about to enſlave, or ſell them to any other; or a furious going about to deſtroy them, are in the opinion of the moſt Monarchical Lawyers, ſuch Abuſes, that they naturally diveſt thoſe that are guilty of them, of their whole Authority. <hi>Infancy</hi> or <hi>Phrenzy</hi> do alſo put them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Guardianſhip of others. All the Crowned Heads of <hi>Europe</hi> have, at leaſt ſecretly, approved of the putting the late <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Portugal</hi> under a Guardianſhip, and the keeping him ſtill a Priſoner, for a few Acts of Rage, that had been fatal to a very few Perſons: And even our Court gave the firſt counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to it, though of all others the late King had the leaſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to have done it, at leaſt laſt of all, ſince it juſtified a younger Brother's ſupplanting the Elder; yet the Evidence of the Thing carried it even againſt Intereſt. Therefore if a King goes about to ſubvert the Government, and to overturn the whole Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, he by this muſt be ſuppoſed, either to fall from his Power, or at leaſt from the Exerciſe of it, ſo far as that he ought to be put under Guardians; and according to the Caſe of <hi>Portugal,</hi> the next Heir falls naturally to be the Guardian.</p>
            <p n="16">XVI. The next Thing to be conſidered, is to ſee in Fact, whether the Foundations of this <hi>Government</hi> have been ſtruck at, and whether thoſe Errors that have been perhaps committed, are only ſuch Malverſations as ought to be imputed only to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Frailty, and to the Ignorance, Inadvertencies, or Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to which all Princes may be ſubject, as well as other Men. But this will beſt appear, if we conſider what are the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Points of our Government, and the chief Securities that we have for our Liberties.</p>
            <p>The Authority of the Law is indeed all in one word, ſo that if the King pretends to a Power to diſpenſe with Laws, there is nothing left upon which the Subject can depend; and yet as if the Diſpenſing Power were not enough, if Laws are wholly ſuſpended for all Time coming, this is plainly a repealing of them, when likewiſe the Men, in whoſe Hands the Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:101251:69"/> of Juſtice is put by Law, ſuch as Judges and Sheriffs are allowed to tread all Laws under-foot, even thoſe that infer an Incapacity on themſelves if they violate them: this is ſuch a breaking of the whole Conſtitution, that we can no more have the Adminiſtration of Juſtice, ſo that it is really a Diſſolution of the Government; ſince all Trials, Sentences, and the Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of them are become ſo many unlawful Acts, that are null and void of themſelves.</p>
            <p>The next Thing in our Conſtitution, which ſecures to us our <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Liberties,</hi> is a <hi>Free</hi> and <hi>Lawful Parliament.</hi> Now, not to mention the breach of the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Triennial Parliaments,</hi> it being above three Years ſince we had a Seſſion that enacted any Law; Methods have been taken, and are daily a taking, that render this impoſſible. <hi>Parliaments</hi> ought to be choſen with an entire Liberty, and without either Force or Preingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: whereas if all Men are required before-hand to enter into Engagements, how they will vote if they are choſen them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves? or how they will give their Voices in the electing of others? This is plainly ſuch a preparation to a <hi>Parliament,</hi> as would indeed make it no <hi>Parliament,</hi> but a <hi>Cabal;</hi> if one were choſen after all that Corruption of Perſons who had prein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged themſelves, and after the Threating and Turning out of all Perſons out of Imployments who had refuſed to do it: And if there are ſuch daily Regulations made in the Towns, that it is plain thoſe who manage them, intend at laſt to put ſuch a number of Men in the Corporations, as will certainly chooſe the Perſons who are recommended to them. But above all, if there are ſuch a number of Sheriffs and Mayors made over <hi>England,</hi> by whom the Elections muſt be conducted and returned, who are now under an Incapacity by Law, and ſo are no legal Officers, and by conſequence thoſe Elections that paſs under their Authority are null and void: If, I ſay, it is clear that things are brought to this, then the Government is diſſolved, becauſe it is impoſſible to have a <hi>Free and Legal Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> in this ſtate of things. If then both the Authority of the <hi>Law,</hi> and the Conſtitution of the <hi>Parliament</hi> are ſtruck at and diſſolved, here is a plain Subverſion of the whole Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But if we enter next into the particular Branches of the Government, we will find the like Diſorder among them all.</p>
            <pb n="130" facs="tcp:101251:70"/>
            <p>The Proteſtant Religion, and the Church of <hi>England</hi> make a great Article of our Government, the latter being ſecured, not only of old by <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> but by many ſpecial <hi>Laws</hi> made of late; and there are particular <hi>Laws</hi> made in K. <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, and the late King's Time, ſecuring them from all Commiſſions that the King can raiſe for Judging or Cenſuring them. If then in oppoſition to this, a Court ſo condemned is erected, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds to judg and cenſure the Clergy, and even to diſſeiſe them of their Free-holds, without ſo much as the form of a Trial, though this is the moſt indiſpenſible <hi>Law</hi> of all thoſe that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the Property of <hi>England;</hi> and if the King pretends that he can require the Clergy to publiſh all his Arbitrary Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and in particular one that ſtrikes at their whole Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and has ordered Proceſs to be begun againſt all that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey'd this illegal Warrant; and has treated ſo great a number of the Biſhops as Criminals, only for repreſenting to him the Reaſons of their not obeying him. If likewiſe the King is not ſatisfied to profeſs his own Religion openly, though even that is contrary to <hi>Law,</hi> but has ſent Ambaſſadors to <hi>Rome,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Nuncio's from thence, which is plainly Treaſon by Law; If likewiſe many Popiſh Churches and Chappels have been publickly opened; if ſeveral Colledges of Jeſuits have been ſet up in divers parts of the Nation, and one of the Order has been made a Privy Counſellor, and a principal Miniſter of State: And if Papiſts, and even thoſe who turn to that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, though declared Traitors by <hi>Law,</hi> are brought into all the chief Imployments, both Military and Civil; then it is plain, That all the Rights of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the whole Eſtabliſhment of the Proteſtant Religion are ſtruck at, and deſign'd to be overturn'd; ſince all theſe Things, as they are notoriouſly illegal, ſo they evidently demonſtrate, That the great Deſign of them all, is the rooting out of this Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Hereſy, in their Stile, I mean, the Proteſtant Religion.</p>
            <p>In the next place, If in the whole courſe of Juſtice, it is viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that there is a conſtant practiſing upon the Judges, that they are turned out upon their varying from the Intentions of the Court; and if Men of no Reputation nor Abilities are put in their places; If an Army is kept up in time of Peace, and Men who withdraw from that illegal Service, are hanged up as
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:101251:70"/> Criminals, without any colour of Law, which by conſequence are ſo many Murders; and if the Souldiery are connived at and encouraged in the moſt enormous Crimes, that ſo they may be thereby prepared to commit greater ones, and from ſingle Rapes and Murders proceed to a Rape upon all our Liberties, and a Deſtruction of the Nation: If, I ſay, all theſe things are true in Fact; then it is plain, that there is ſuch a Diſſolution of the Government made, that there is not any one part of it left ſound and entire: And if all theſe things are done now, it is eaſy to imagine what may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, when Arbitrary Power, that ſpares to Man, and Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that ſpares no Heretick, are finally eſtabliſhed: Then we may look for nothing but Gabelles, Tailles, Impoſitions, Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violences, and all ſorts of Illegal Taxes; as from the other we may expect Burning, Maſſacres, and Inquiſitions. In what is doing in <hi>Scotland,</hi> we may gather what is to be expected in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> where if the King has over and over again declared, that he is veſted with an Abſolute Power, to which all are bound to obey without reſerve, and has upon that annulled almoſt all the Acts of Parliament that paſſed in K. <hi>James</hi> I. Minority, though they were ratified by himſelf when he came to be of Age, and were confirmed by all the ſubſequent Kings, not excepting the preſent. We muſt then conclude from thence, what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved on here in <hi>England,</hi> and what will be put in Execution as ſoon as it is thought that the Times can bear it. When likewiſe the whole Settlement of <hi>Ireland</hi> is ſhaken, and the Army that was raiſed, and is maintained by Taxes that were given for an Army of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proteſtants, to ſecure them from a new Maſſacre by the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſts, is now all filled with <hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſts, as well as almoſt all the other Imployments; it is plain, that not only all the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Proteſtants inhabiting that Iſland, are in daily danger of being butchered a ſecond time, but that the Crown of <hi>England</hi> is in danger of loſing that Iſland, it being now put wholly into the Hands and Power of the Native <hi>Iriſh,</hi> who as they formerly offered themſelves up ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> ſometimes to the Pope, and once to the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> ſo are they perhaps at this preſent treating with another Court for the Sale and Surrender of the Iſland, and for the Maſſacre of the Engliſh in it.</p>
            <pb n="132" facs="tcp:101251:71"/>
            <p>If thus all the ſeveral Branches of our Conſtitution are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, it might be at leaſt expected that one part ſhould be left entire, and that is the <hi>Regal Dignity.</hi> And yet even that is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted, when we ſee a <hi>young Child</hi> put in the Reverſion of it, and pretended to be the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Wales:</hi> concerning whoſe being born of the <hi>Queen,</hi> there appear to be not only no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Proofs, but there are all the Preſumptions that can poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be imagined to the contrary. No Proofs were ever given, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Princeſs of <hi>Denmark,</hi> or to any other Proteſtant La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, in whom we ought to repoſe any Confidence, that the <hi>Queen</hi> was ever with Child; that whole Matter being managed with ſo much Myſteriouſneſs, that there were violent and publick Suſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions of it before the Birth. But the whole Contrivance of the Birth, the ſending away the Princeſs of <hi>Denmark,</hi> the ſudden ſhortning of the <hi>Reckoning,</hi> the <hi>Queen's</hi> ſudden going to St. <hi>James</hi>'s, her no leſs ſudden pretended Delivery; the hurrying the Child into another Room without ſhewing it to thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and without their hearing it cry; and the myſterious Conduct of all ſince that time; no Satisfaction being given to the Princeſs of <hi>Denmark</hi> upon her Return from the <hi>Bath,</hi> nor to any other Proteſtant Ladies, of the <hi>Queen's</hi> having been really brought to Bed. Theſe are all ſuch evident Indications of a baſe Impoſture in this Matter, that as the Nation has the juſteſt Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the World to doubt of it, ſo they have all poſſible Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be at no quiet till they ſee a Legal and Free Parliament aſſembled, which may impartially, and without either Fear or Corruption, examine that whole Matter.</p>
            <p>If all theſe Matters are true in Fact, then I ſuppoſe no Man will doubt, that the whole Foundations of this Government, and all the moſt ſacred Parts of it, are overturned. And as to the Truth of all theſe Suppoſitions, that is left to every <hi>Engliſh-man's</hi> Judgment and Senſe.</p>

            <head>A REVIEW of the REFLECTIONS ON THE Prince of ORANGE's DECLARATION.</head>
            <p n="1">1. THE Prince's unwillingneſs to charge the Gowern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with any thing but what was evident and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable, affords the Reflection with which this Paper begins: That all the noiſe of a ſecret League with <hi>France</hi> has been only a feigned Danger, and a falſe Fear, ſince it is not ſo much as mentioned in the Prince's Declaration. It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador aſſerted it in a publick Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and in a Memorial given in to the States General at the <hi>Hague;</hi> and all the World has clearly ſeen through the Grimmace that the Court of <hi>England</hi> made upon it to Mr. <hi>Skel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton;</hi> for it is not to be ſuppoſed, that the Court of <hi>France</hi> would have publiſhed this Alliance, unleſs it had been made, or that they would have made it, unleſs they had ſeen full Powers for it in Mr. <hi>Skelton</hi>'s hands. But after all, as the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of it are ſecret, ſo the Court of <hi>England</hi> having diſown'd it, the Prince's exactneſs in not mentioning a doubtful thing, deſerved rather a Reflection in his Favour.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Reflector is offended at the Prince's uſing the Stile of We and Us, for it ſeems <hi>Thou</hi> and <hi>Thee</hi> are ſo dear to him, that he cannot hear any thing out of that Cant. But though by the Connivance of our Court, <hi>France</hi> has robb'd the Prince of his Principality, yet the Rights and Dignity of a Soveraign Prince remain ſtill with him, which will juſtify his ſpeaking in the plural number: And the other terms of Authority that
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:101251:72"/> are in his Declaration, being the uſual Stile of all that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand Armies, his uſing them imports no more, than that he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to uſe Force for the reſtoring of our Liberty; and if the Stile is a little high, it is their fault who would not hearken to ſofter and humbler Repreſentations, and that had made it a Crime ſo much as to Petition.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There is nothing works more on weak People, than the faſtning an ill Name even on the beſt Actions, and therefore <hi>Invaſion</hi> being a Term that naturally gives Horror, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flector faſtens that upon the Prince's Attempt to ſave the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but things appear now too broad to be diſguiſed, and therefore the wiſe and worthy part of the Nation eſteems that to be a <hi>Deliverance,</hi> which is here called an <hi>Invaſion.</hi> It is true, the Prince promiſes to ſend back his Forces, which imports, that he intends to ſtay behind; for he having engaged to ſee a Free Parliament called and aſſembled, muſt ſtay after his Army is ſent away, ſince no Parliament can be choſen with Freedom, while the Nation is over-awed by a Military Power; but when that is laid down of all hands, then the Prince will be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to ſee the Promiſe that he has made to the Nation for a Free Parliament executed. So that all the malicious Inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations of his aſpiring to be King, which return ſo often in the Reflections, are thrown out only to create an unjuſt Jealouſie of His Highneſs's Intentions.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Security which the Reflector promiſes to the Nation, and the Religion, by the Concurrence of Proteſtants to ſave the Court, is now a little too late, the ſame Cheat will hardly paſs twice. This had once a great effect in bringing the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion off from the deſign of the Excluſion, and Men in the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of their Heart believed it. But the Court has taken ſo much pains to convince them of their Error, and has ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded ſo effectually in it, that it is too great an impoſing upon us, to fancy that we can be ſo ſoon deluded again in the ſame manner. We know now, by ſad expererience, what all the Promiſes and Oaths that a Papiſt can make to Proteſtants do ſignify; and we ſee how little is to be built even on the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of a Prince, when a Jeſuit has the keeping of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. Nor can it be any Reproach on our Religion, if the Nation comes under the Protection of a Prince that has
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:101251:72"/> ſo near an Intereſt in the Succeſſion to the Crown, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it ſelf and the Eſtabliſh'd Religion from the Conſpiracies of thoſe who intend to deſtroy both, and had made a great way in it, and would have probably brought their Deſigns to a full Ripeneſs this Winter, if the Prince's coming had not check'd them. The Reflector thinks the Prince ought to have turned his Arms rather on <hi>France,</hi> and allows that he has a juſt Right to do it. But <hi>England</hi> had a greater Title to his Protection, and ought to have been firſt taken care of by him, and when that is once done, the Propoſition here made, with relation to <hi>France,</hi> may be more ſeaſonable.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Great Exceptions are taken, becauſe the Prince founds the Invaſions that are made on the Proteſtant Religion, on this, that it is the Religion eſtabliſh'd by Law; ſince our Reflector tells us, that it is the Truth and not the Legality of a Religion that is its Warrant; and that otherwiſe Paganiſm and Judaiſm had been ſtill the Eſtabliſh'd Religion. But the Reflector con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founds things of different Natures. If we conſider Religion, as it gives us a Title to the Favour of God, and to Eternal Happineſs, we ought to have no regard but to the Truth of it. But when Religion is conſidered as the firſt of all Civil Rights, then the Legal Eſtabliſhment is the Foundation of its Title: And if Legiſlators had not changed Laws, Paganiſm had been ſtill the Legal Religion, notwithſtanding its falſhood; and though the Truth of the Chriſtian Religion is the only ground upon which we believe it, yet it muſt become Legal as well as it is true, before we can claim the Protection of the Law and the Government that has ſecured it to us; ſo that to fight againſt Popery, where that is the Eſtabliſh'd Religion, is as certainly a Sin, as it is a Debt that we owe our Religion and Country, to fight for the Proteſtant Religion, when the Law is for it, and illegal Violence is imployed to pull it down.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The Reflector's Common-place-ſtuff, with relation to the Diſpenſing Power, has been ſo oft expoſed, that it ſcarce deſerves a Review. The Obligation of all Laws depends on the force of the Penalties againſt Trangreſſors; ſo that the Diſpenſing with Penal Laws, carries in it the Diſpenſing with all Laws whatſoever; and by this Doctrine, the whole Frame and Security of our Government is at the King's Diſcretion:
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:101251:73"/> Nor will that diſtinction of <hi>malum in ſe,</hi> and <hi>malum prohibitum</hi> ſave the matter, unleſs all the World were agreed upon the point, What things are evil of themſelves, and what not. In the ſenſe of a Papiſt, all the Laws againſt their Religion are ſo far from being Obligatory of their own Nature, that they are impious Attempts upon that Authority which they think infallible. Therefore all the diſtinction that is offered to ſave us from the exorbitancy of this Diſpenſing Power, as if it could not reach to things that are evil of themſelves, is of no force, unleſs a meaſure were laid down, in which both Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants and Papiſts were agreed concerning things that are good or evil of themſelves. For inſtance, Murther is allowed by all to be evil of it ſelf; yet if the Extirpation of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks is a Duty incumbent on a Catholick King, as we are ſure it is, then a Commiſſion given to deſtroy us, would be a juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable Action; and ſo the Laws againſt Murder and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaughter might in that caſe be diſpenſed with, ſince the killing of Hereticks is by the Doctrine of Papiſts only <hi>Malum prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> and not <hi>malum in ſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. Our Author might have ſpar'd his Rhetorick how well ſoever he loads it upon the Head of Perſecution and Liberty of Conſcience, if it had been but for this Reaſon, that it diſcover'd too plainly who it was that wrote theſe Reflections, which perhaps he may have e're long ſome Reaſons to wiſh it were not ſo well known, as he has taken pains to do by his luxuriant Stile. All that can be ſaid on this Head, belongs very pertinently to the Conſideration of a Parliament, but is very improperly urged in favour of the bloodieſt of all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors, who could not begin their breaking in upon our Laws and our Religion more dextrouſly than at this of Liberty of Conſcience, tho they themſelves had been the Authors of all the Severities that had been acted among us, and intended by this ſhew of Eaſe to bring us under all the Cruelties of an Inquiſition, which is one of the inſeparable Perquiſites of that bloody Religion.</p>
            <p n="8">8. The greateſt part of the Invaſions made on our Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that are ſet forth in the Prince's Declaration, are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to be ſuch by our Reflector: But he thinks they are now redreſſed. The High Commiſſion is at an end; <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalen</hi>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:101251:73"/> Colledge is reſtor'd. If the King had of his own motion, and from a ſenſe of the juſtice of the thing, done all this while he apprehended no danger, and if he had brought the Authors of thoſe Pernicious Councils to condign Puniſhment, then it had been more reaſonable to value thoſe Acts of Juſtice, by which the former Violences had been in ſome meaſure repaired: but what is done in the preſent Circumſtances, ſhews only a meanneſs of Spirit, and a feebleneſs in the Government: And ſome Mens Tempers are too well known, to ſuffer us once to doubt of their returning back to all their former Violences, and of their carrying them on to greater Exceſſes; if God for the ſins of the Nation, ſhould blaſt this Glorious Undertaking. And if the Charters are now reſtor'd, we know by the Proceedings of the late Regulators of Corporations, that it was far from their thoughts but a little while ago; ſo that this is likewiſe an effect of the preſent Fear they are under; and it ſhews that after all their Huffings during their Proſperity, they ſink under Dangers as much as others, whoſe Memory they are ſo careful to blemiſh, how much ſoever they are beholden to them. It is here ſaid, that moſt of the Charters were taken away in the late King's time: But as it is well known under whoſe Influence the laſt years of the late Reign were conducted, ſo the limiting the Elections to a ſpeical number, contrary to Cuſtom and Preſcription, was the Invention of the preſent Reign.</p>
            <p n="9">9. But if the Reflector will not juſtify every thing that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment has done, and thinks the preſent ſtate of things could hardly bear ſo groſs an Abuſe; yet he inſiſts often upon this, that theſe Illegal things were fit for the Conſideration and the Redreſs of a Parliament, and that they do not juſtify the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Attempt. But the Prince's Deſign is only to ſee a Free Parliament Choſen and Aſſembled according to Law. For our Author and his Complices (for he reckons him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the Miniſtry §. 23. when he names the things ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected againſt the Miniſtry, as objected <hi>againſt us,</hi>) had taken ſuch care to keep off a Parliament, and to overturn all Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, to corrupt all Elections, and to provide for falſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns by Popiſh Sheriffs and Mayors, that we were out of all hopes, or rather out of a poſſibility of ever ſeeing a Free Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament again; ſo that any nearer Proſpect that we now have
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:101251:74"/> of one, is wholly owing to the Prince's Undertaking; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed what is given us at preſent, is done with ſo ill a Grace, and the Popiſh and corrupt Miniſtry, is ſtill preſerved and cheriſhed with ſo particular a Confidence, that they ſeem to have a mind to make the Nation ſee that all is done ſo groſly, that thoſe who are cheated by it, will have no excuſe for their Folly, ſince the <hi>trick</hi> is acted with too bare a face to paſs on any.</p>
            <p n="10">10. The Reflector thinks that the Prince ought to have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained to the King of theſe Abuſes, though in other places of this Paper, he pretends that the Prince was not a proper Judg in thoſe Matters; he aggravates the Prince's breaking with an Uncle and a Father-in-Law without warning given. Indeed, if this were the Caſe, all that could be ſaid upon it, was, that he had copied from the Pattern that was ſet him in 1672, in that famous Attempt on the <hi>Sinirna</hi> Fleet: What Complaints the Prince made, or what encouragement he had to make any, and how they were entertain'd and anſwer'd, are domeſtick matters, of which the World knows little, ſince all that has appear'd in publick was in Mr. <hi>Fagel</hi>'s Letter; and how well that was received and how civilly it was anſwer'd, all <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> ſaw. It is true, the Prince is very nearly related to the King, but there are other Ties ſtronger than the Bonds of Fleſh and Blood; He owes more to the Proteſtant Religion and to the Nation, than can be defaced by any other Relation what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever; and if the faling in one Relation excuſes the other, then enough might be ſaid, to ſhew at what pains the Court of <hi>England</hi> has been, to free the Prince from all other Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, except thoſe of <hi>Loving Enemies,</hi> and doing good to thoſe who <hi>deſpitefully uſe us,</hi> for upon this account the Prince lies under all poſſible Obligations.</p>
            <p n="11">11. The Reflector thinks, that thoſe who left <hi>Ireland,</hi> were driven by a needleſs Fear; but tho' he has no reaſon to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend much from the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſts, yet thoſe who ſaw the laſt Bloody <hi>Maſſacre,</hi> may be forgiven, if they have no mind to ſee ſuch another. He faintly blames that great Change that was lately made in the whole Government of <hi>Ireland;</hi> but he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently excuſes it, ſince it was natural for the King and his Friends to deſire to be ſafe ſome where; till they had fair Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in <hi>England,</hi> they muſt make ſure of <hi>Ireland;</hi> but he adds,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:101251:74"/> that as ſoon as that was done, the thing muſt have returned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to its old Channel again. This ought to be writ only to <hi>Iriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> for none of a higher ſize of Underſtanding can bear it; if it can ever be ſhewed that Papiſts have yielded up any thing, which they had once wrung out of the Hands of Proteſtants, except when they were forced to it; we may believe this, and all the other groſs things which are here impoſed on us. The plain Caſe was, the Papiſts reſolved to deſtroy us, and to put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in caſe to do it as ſoon as was poſſible. So they went about it immediately in <hi>Ireland,</hi> only they have delay'd the giving the Signal for a new <hi>Maſſacre,</hi> till Matters were ripe for it in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="12">12. The Reflector has reaſon to avoid the ſaying any thing to the Article of <hi>Scotland,</hi> for even his Confidence could not ſupport him in juſtifying the King's claiming an Abſolute Power, to which all are bound to obey without reſerve, and the Repeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a great many Laws upon that Pretenſion; this is too groſs for Humane Nature, and the Principles of all Religions whatſoever. Our Author avoids ſpeaking to it, becauſe he does not know the Extent of the Prerogative of that Crown. But no Prerogative can go to an Obedience without Reſerve, nor can Abſolute Power conſiſt with any Legal Government.</p>
            <p n="13">13. The Declaration had ſet forth, that the Evil Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors had repreſented the Expedient, offer'd by the Prince and Princeſs, as offer'd on deſign to diſturb the Quiet and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Kingdom; upon which the Reflector beſtows this kind Remark on the Miniſtry: And did they not ſay true, as it happens? Believe me, ſome Folks think many of them are not often guilty of ſuch forelight: The Writer is angry that his Side is not uppermoſt; and tho' he includes himſelf in the Miniſtry by ſaying Us, when he ſpeaks of them, yet here, tho' he was to cenſure the Party that is againſt him, he diſtinguiſhes them, by ſaying, many of the Counſellors uſe not to have ſuch foreſight: But perhaps they can object as much to his foreſight, and with as much reaſon. But if the King comes up to Mr. <hi>Fagel</hi>'s Letter, why was it rejected with ſo much Scorn, and anſwered with ſo much Inſolence? Now perhaps they would hearken to it, when they have brought both themſelves and the Nation to the brink of Ruin, by their mad Councils: But
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:101251:75"/> they ought to be forgiven, ſince they have been true to the Principles and Dictates of their Religion.</p>
            <p n="14">14. Our Reflector thinks a Free Parliament a <hi>Chimera,</hi> and indeed he and his Friends have been at a great deal of pains to render it impoſſible. But perhaps he may be quickly cured of his Error, and a Free One is the ſooner like to be choſen, when he, and ſuch as he, are ſet at a due diſtance from the Publick Councils. If Members are ſometimes choſen by Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and other Practices, this is bad enough, but ſtill it is not ſo bad as the laying a Force upon the Electors, and a Reſtraint upon the Election. Nor is it very much to the King's Honour, to remember how the laſt Parliament was choſen; it was indeed a very diſguſting Eſſay in the beginning of a Reign, and gave a ſad proſpect of what might be look'd for; but if one Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence was born with, when the ſtruggle of another Party ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to excuſe it; this does not prove that a courſe of ſuch Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences, when the Deſign is become both more viſible, and leſs excuſable, ought to be endured. If the Members of that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament proved Worthy Patriots, I do not ſee why they ought not to be remembred with Honour, tho' there is a great deal to be ſaid upon their firſt elevation to that Character, which they maintained indeed nobly; ſo that if the firſt Conception of the Parliament was Irregular, yet its End was Honourable, ſince never a Parliament was diſſolv'd upon a more Glorious Account.</p>
            <p n="15">15. The Reflector ſets up all his Sail, when he enters upon the Article of the pretended Prince of <hi>Wales:</hi> This was a Point by which he hoped to merit highly, and upon that, to gain ground on that Party of the Court, on whom he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected with ſo much ſcorn. Therefore here muſt the Prince be attack'd, with all the malicious Force to which his Rhetorick could carry him; and all thoſe Men of Honour that went over to wait on him at the <hi>Hague</hi> and to repreſent to him the bleeding and deſperate Condition of the Nation, muſt be ſtigmatized as a lewd Crew of Renegadoes; tho, I muſt tell him, that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon acceptation of Renegado, is one that changes his Religion, and by this he will find ſome near him to whom that Character belongs more juſtly. He almoſt blames the King for the low Step he lately made to prove that Birth: It was a low one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:101251:75"/> to make ſo much ado, and to bring together ſuch a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Appearance, to hear ſo ſlight a Proof produced; which could have no other Effect, but to make the Impoſture ſo much the more viſible, when the utmoſt Attempts to ſupport it, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be now ſo feeble, that as to the main Point of the Queen's bearing the Child, there is not ſo much as a colour of a Proof produc'd: And it is certain, that if this had been a fair thing, the Court would have ſo managed it, that it ſhould not have been in the Power of any Mortal to have called it in queſtion: And on the other hand, they have ſo managed it, that one muſt needs ſee, in every ſtep of it, broad Marks of an Impoſture. It will not be half Proofs, nor ſuborned Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, that will ſatisfy the Nation in ſo great a Point. But I will enter into no Particulars relating to this Buſineſs, which will be better laid open when a Free Parliament meets to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine it.</p>
            <p n="16">16. The Reflector charges upon the Prince all the Miſeries that may follow on a War, as an unſuitable return to the Kindneſs that the Nation has ſhewed him. But if the Diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Government, brought on by the Court, has given a juſt Riſe to his coming, then the ill Effects that may fall out in the Progreſs of his Deſign, are no more to be charged on him, than the Miſeries to which a ſevere Cure of the ill Effects of a wilful Diſorder, expoſe a Patient, ought to be imputed to a Phyſician, that betrays his Patient if he flatters him; and that muſt apply violent Remedies to obſtinate Diſtempers. I do not hear from other Hands, that the Lords and Biſhops a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the City have diſowned their inviting the Prince: and I do not believe it the better, becauſe the Author affirms it. But if it were true, there are others in <hi>England</hi> beſides thoſe about the City: ſo the thing may be true, though a few about the City had not been in it. A ſmall Civility is beſtowed on the Prince, when it is ſaid, that he would not have affirmed it, if he did not believe it; but this is ſoon taken off, and it is ſaid, doubtleſs he was abuſed in this. If this is to be ſuppoſed, the Prince is as weak a Man, as his Enemies, for their own ſakes, ought to wiſh to be; if he could ſuffer himſelf to be engaged in a matter of this nature, without being well aſſured of the grounds he went on.</p>
            <pb n="142" facs="tcp:101251:76"/>
            <p n="17">17. What is ſaid of the Prince's referring all matters to the determination of a Free Parliament, is too flat to require an Anſwer: This was a plauſible thing, and therefore it ought to have been either quite paſt over, or ſomewhat of force ought to have been ſet againſt it. This is not the referring of other peoples Rights to a Parliament; but the leaving the healing of the Nation to thoſe who are its proper Phyſicians. And the taking a Cure out of the hands of the Court, inſtead of that, is like the renouncing a ſure Method and a good Phyſician, and the hearkening to the arrogant promiſes of a bold Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebank. The Prince has promiſed to ſend away his Army as ſoon as the ſtate of the Nation will permit, upon which the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flector ſays, that here is but a Foreigner's word againſt our own King's; and he refers it to our Allegiance to judg; which of the two we ought to truſt. But I cannot find out in what the Prince's promiſe contradicts any that the King has made; for I do not hear that the King has promiſed that theſe Troops ſhall not return; and unleſs that were the Caſe, I cannot find out the Contradiction; and after all, if we muſt ſpeak out, there is ſome odds to be made between a Prince whoſe Religion, as well as his Honour, has ever determined him to keep all his Promiſes, and another whoſe Religion has taught him ſo often to make bold with all his.</p>
            <p n="18">18. The <hi>Prince</hi>'s ſummoning the Nobility and Gentry, as it is the uſual ſtile of all Generals, ſo it requires them only to appear and to act for their Country and their Religion; and his promiſing to have a <hi>Parliament</hi> called in <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports no more but that he is come with a Reſolution to have the Government ſetled on its true Baſis, and that he will ſee it done.</p>
            <p n="19">19. The Reflector is in great wrath, becauſe the <hi>Prince</hi> has, in his Additional Declaration, ſhewed how little regard ought to be had to that imperfect Redreſs of Grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that has been offered of late. But it had been a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring in the Cheat, to ſuffer it to paſs, without laying it open: When fair things are offered from Men to whom we ought to truſt, it is as ſeaſonable to receive them, as it is to reject all deceitful things, when the Truth is apparent. Therefore as the <hi>Prince</hi> had no reaſon to abandon the Cure of the Nation, after the ſteps that he had made, becauſe of the
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:101251:76"/> endeavours of the Court to lay it aſleep; ſo he has ſo purged himſelf from the Imputations of deſigning a Conqueſt, that all our Reflector's Malice cannot make them ſtick; and all that Noble Company that came over with him, and that have ſince come in to him, are a proof of this beyond Exception. Let all Men of Senſe judg, whether an Army compoſed of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Iriſh Papiſts,</hi> or another made up of ſo many Noblemen and Gentlemen of great Families and Eſtates, are likelieſt to ſet about the Conquering the Nation.</p>
            <p n="20">20. He fancies, that what the Prince gets by the Sword, he will keep by the Sword: And upon this he tells us, that he ſaid Once to the King, that the bringing the <hi>Dutch Army</hi> to the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline in which it was, had coſt 1300 Lives: Upon which he wiſhes thoſe who value the <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and Trials by Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to make ſome Reflections. But ſince the Situation and Conſtitution of <hi>Holland,</hi> makes an Army neceſſary to them; and ſince they have provided, by particular Laws, that Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal Diſcipline ſhould be maintain'd by a Council of War, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could have been contriv'd more for the Prince's Honour, than to tell us that he has ſo ordered the Matter, that the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my is become one of the moſt regular and inoffenſive Bodies of Men that is in all <hi>Holland:</hi> which this Nation ſees now, with no ſmall aſtoniſhment; to whom one Regiment of <hi>Iriſh</hi> has given more Fear and Diſorder, than this great Army has done to the places through which it has paſſed. The Reflector tells us alſo, as a very ridiculous thing, that the Prince, who has left the <hi>Dutch</hi> no Liberty at Home, comes now to ſecure ours here. And to make the Parallel compleat, between the Prince and a near Relation of his, he pretends that he broke his Oath to the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> he having promiſed never to be <hi>Statholder,</hi> though it ſhould be offer'd him: And to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all againſt him, he ſays, there is no more proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Ancient Liberties of <hi>Holland,</hi> and his preſent Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, than there is between <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Brandford.</hi> Here is the Force of all his Malice, but we who have ſeen the State of Affairs in <hi>Holland,</hi> and the Freedom of the Government there, know that <hi>England</hi> can wiſh for no greater Happineſs, than that the Laws and Government here, may be maintained as exactly here, as they are there: And the late Unanimous
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:101251:77"/> Concurrence of all the Provinces, and of all the Negatives in every Province, and not only of all the Members in every one of theſe Bodies, but indeed of the whole People all over the Provinces, <hi>Amſterdam</hi> it ſelf leading the way to all the reſt, by which they gave their Fleet, their Army, and their Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſo frankly up to the <hi>Prince,</hi> was an Evidence of his good Government, beyond all that can be ſet forth in words; for real Arguments conclude always truly. And for the <hi>Prince</hi>'s Oath, it was an Obligation to the States, and was intended, even by thoſe who framed it, only to hinder all Caballing for obtaining any ſuch Offer to be made him. But when they were brought to that Extremity, to which we helped to drive them, ſo that there was a change made in the greateſt part of the whole Government, they Unanimouſly found the neceſſity of Veſting the <hi>Prince</hi> with the full Authority of <hi>Statholder;</hi> and therefore the Oath being made to them, it was in their power to give it up: So that here was no breach of Oath, but only a Relaxation of the Obligation that was made to the States. The Reflections end with a piece of Railery, which might paſs, if it were either witty or decent: But if the things that are objected ſeem irregular, I fancy that Mr. <hi>Pen</hi>'s writing for Popery, and Mr. <hi>Stewart</hi>'s for Tyranny, are things every whit as Incongruous as any of theſe, with which the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flector diverts himſelf.</p>

            <p>I Know the Diſadvantages of pleading ones Innocence, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when he is proſecuted at the Suit of his Natural <hi>Prince,</hi> to whom he owes ſo profound a Duty: and this has kept me ſo long in a reſpectful ſilence, after I had ſeen my Name in ſo many <hi>Gazettes,</hi> aſperſed with the blackeſt of all Crimes: But there is both a time to be ſilent, and a time to ſpeak. And as hitherto I have kept my ſelf within the bounds of the one, ſo I do now take the Liberty which the other al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows me: But I was not hitherto ſilent where I ought to ſpeak; for I have made many humble Addreſſes to his Majeſty, by the Earl of <hi>Middletoun</hi> his Secretary of State; hoping that my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence, joined with my moſt humble Duty, would have broke through all thoſe Prejudices and falſe Informations with which my Enemies had poſſeſſed his Majeſty againſt me.</p>
            <p>Upon the firſt Notice that I had of his Majeſty's having writ to the <hi>Privy Council</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> ordering <hi>Proceſs</hi> to be iſſued out againſt me for <hi>High Treaſon,</hi> I writ my <hi>Firſt Letter:</hi> In that I could enter into no Particulars; for in the Advertiſement that was ſent me, it was ſaid, that there was no ſpecial Matter
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:101251:78"/> laid to my Charge in the <hi>King's Letter.</hi> Some days after that, I received a Copy of my <hi>Citation,</hi> to which I preſently writ an <hi>Anſwer,</hi> and ſent that with my <hi>Second Letter</hi> to the ſame <hi>Noble Perſon;</hi> to both theſe <hi>Letters</hi> I received no Anſwer; but I was advertiſed, that ſome Exceptions were taken at ſome words in my <hi>Firſt Letter,</hi> and this led me to write my <hi>Third Letter,</hi> for explaining and juſtifying thoſe words. I have kept my ſelf thus within all thoſe Bounds that I thought my Duty ſet me; and am not a little troubled, that I am now forced to ſpeak for my ſelf. I have delayed doing it, as long as I had any reaſon to hope, that my Juſtification of my ſelf was like to produce the Effect which I moſt humbly deſired, and which I expected: But now the <hi>Day</hi> of my Appearance being come, in which it is probable <hi>Sentence</hi> will paſs againſt me, ſince I have had no Intimations given me to the contrary, I hope it will not ſhew either the leaſt Impatience, or the want of that Submiſſion, which I have on all Occaſions payed to every thing that comes to me from that Authority, under which God had placed me, that I publiſh theſe Papers for my own Vindication. If it had been only in defence of my <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Reputation,</hi> that I had been led to appear in ſuch a manner, I could have more eaſily reſtrained my ſelf: and have left theſe to be Sacrifices to the Unjuſt Rage of thoſe, who have ſo far prevailed on his Majeſty's readineſs to believe them, as to drive this Matter ſo far: but the Honour of that <hi>Holy Religion</hi> which I profeſs, and the Regard I bear to that <hi>Sacred Function</hi> to which I am dedicated, lay ſuch Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on me, that I am determined by them, to declare my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence to the World; which I intend to do more copiouſly within a little while: but in the mean time, I hope the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>Papers</hi> will ſerve to ſhew how clear I am of all the Matters that are laid to my charge.</p>
            <p>There is one Particular, which is come to my knowledg ſince I writ my Anſwer, that will yet more evidently diſcover my Innocence: I have received certain Informations from <hi>England,</hi> that both <hi>Sir John Cochran</hi> and his <hi>Son,</hi> and <hi>Mr. Baxter,</hi> have declared upon many occaſions, and to many Perſons, that they cannot imagin how they come to be cited as <hi>Witneſſes</hi> againſt me; that they can ſcarce believe it can be true; ſince
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:101251:78"/> they know nothing that can be any way to my Prejudice; and that they muſt clear me of all the Matters objected to me in this <hi>Citation:</hi> and the <hi>two Witneſſes,</hi> that as it ſeems are cited for that <hi>Article</hi> that relates to <hi>Holland,</hi> have ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared, that they know nothing relating to me, or to the Matters ſpecified in this <hi>Citation,</hi> which <hi>one</hi> of them has ſignified to my ſelf in a <hi>Letter</hi> under his hand; ſo that the Falſehood of this <hi>Accuſation</hi> is ſo evident, that it ſerves to diſcover the Folly, as well as the Impudence of thoſe who have contrived it.</p>
            <p>But it is yet too early to ſet on a <hi>Perſecution</hi> for <hi>Matters of Religion;</hi> therefore Crimes againſt the <hi>State</hi> muſt be pretended, and faſtned on thoſe whom theſe Men intend to deſtroy. And as foul and black Scandals are invented to Defame me, and put in the mouths of thoſe who are ready to believe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port every thing that may diſgrace me, without conſidering that they do a thing that is as unbecoming them, as it is Baſe and Injuſt in it ſelf; ſo all Arts are uſed to deſtroy me; but I truſt to the Protection of that GREAT GOD, who ſees the Injuſtice that is done me, and who will in his own Time and Way vindicate my Innocence; and under him I truſt to the Protection of the <hi>HIGH AND MIGHTY STATES OF HOLLAND AND WEST-FRIESE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LAND.</hi>

               <p>THe Affairs of theſe <hi>Provinces</hi> belonging to your <hi>Lordſhip</hi>'s ſhare in the <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> leads me to make this moſt humble Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to you, and by your <hi>Lordſhip</hi> to his <hi>Majeſty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have received Advertiſement from <hi>Scotland,</hi> that the <hi>King</hi> has writ to the <hi>Privy Council,</hi> ordering me to be proceeded againſt
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:101251:79"/> for <hi>High Treaſon</hi> againſt his Perſon and Government: and that purſuant to this, the <hi>King's Advocate</hi> has cited me to appear there. If any thing in this World can ſurpriſe or diſorder me, this muſt needs do it: For as few have writ more, and preach'd oftner againſt all ſorts of Treaſonable Doctrines and Practices than my ſelf, ſo all the Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries that have been made of late Years, have been ſo far from aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing me, that tho' there has been diſpoſition enough to find fault with me, yet there has not been Matter given ſo much as for an examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It is now thirteen Years ſince I came out of <hi>Scotland;</hi> and for theſe laſt five Years, I have not ſo much as mentioned the commoneſt News in any Letter I have writ to any in that <hi>Kingdom:</hi> I do not mention <hi>Acts of Indemnity,</hi> becauſe I know that I do not need the benefit of them. I went out of <hi>England</hi> by his <hi>Majeſty</hi>'s Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation; and I have ſtayed out of it, becauſe his <hi>Majeſty</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed his diſlike of my returning to it. I am now upon the Point of Marrying in this Country, and am <hi>naturalized</hi> by the <hi>States of Holland:</hi> but tho' by this, <hi>during my ſtay here, my Allegiance is tranſlated from his Majeſty to the Soveraignty of this Province,</hi> yet I will never depart from the profoundeſt reſpect to his Sacred Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and Duty to his Government. Since my coming into theſe Parts, I have not ſeen any one Perſon, either of <hi>Scotland</hi> or <hi>England,</hi> that is Outlaw'd for Treaſon: and when the <hi>King</hi> took Exceptions at the acceſs I had to the Prince and Princeſs of <hi>Orange,</hi> there was not any thing of this kind then objected to me. So I proteſt unto your <hi>Lordſhip,</hi> I do not ſo much as imagine upon what it is that thoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations, which it ſeems are brought to his <hi>Majeſty,</hi> are founded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My Lord,</hi> As I am not aſhamed of any thing I have done, ſo I am not affraid of any thing that my Enemies can do to me: I can very eaſily part with a ſmall Eſtate, and with a Life of which I have been long weary; and if my Engagements in this Country could di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſe with it, I would not avoid the coming to ſtand my <hi>Tryal:</hi> but as this cannot be expected in the ſtate in which I am, ſo I humbly throw my ſelf at His <hi>Majeſtys</hi> feet, and beg, that he may not condemn me ſo much as in his thoughts, till I know what is the Crime that is objected to me, that ſo I may offer a moſt humble Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my ſelf to him. I ſhall be infinitely ſorry if any <hi>Judgment</hi> that may paſs on me in <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſhall oblige me to appear in print in my own Defence: for I cannot betray my own Innocence ſo far as to ſuffer a thing of this nature to paſs upon me, without Printing
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:101251:79"/> an <hi>Apology</hi> for my ſelf; in which I will be forced to make a reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal of all that ſhare that I have had in Affairs theſe twenty years paſt: and in which I muſt mention a vaſt number of particulars, <hi>that I am affraid will be diſpleaſing to His Majeſty: and as I will look on this as one of the greateſt Misfortunes that can poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly befall me, ſo with all the Duty and Humility in the World, I beg I may not be driven to it.</hi> I will not preſume to add one word to your <hi>Lordſhip,</hi> nor to claim any ſort of Favour or Protection from you. For I addreſs my ſelf only to your <hi>Lordſhip</hi> as you are the <hi>Kings Miniſter</hi> for theſe <hi>Provinces.</hi>

               <head>AN ANSWER TO THE <hi>Criminal Letters</hi> iſſued out againſt me.</head>
               <p>I Look upon it as a particular Misfortune, that I am forced to anſwer a <hi>Citation</hi> that is made in his <hi>Majeſty</hi>'s Name; which will be ever ſo ſacred with me, that nothing but the ſenſe of an Indiſpenſable Duty could draw from me any thing that looks like a contending with that ſublime Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.</p>
               <p>I owe the Defence of my own <hi>Innocence</hi> and of my <hi>Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> and <hi>Life</hi> to my <hi>ſelf:</hi> I owe alſo to all my <hi>Kindred</hi> and <hi>Friends,</hi> to my <hi>Religion</hi> as I am a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> and a <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> and to my <hi>Profeſſion</hi> as I am a <hi>Church-man,</hi> and above all, to His <hi>Majeſty,</hi> as I am his <hi>born Subject,</hi> ſuch a Vindication of my <hi>Loyalty</hi> and <hi>Integrity,</hi> as may make it appear, that my not going to <hi>Scotland,</hi> according to the Tenour of this <hi>Citation,</hi> does not flow from any ſenſe of Guilt or Fear, but meerly from thoſe Engagements under which I am in <hi>Holland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I hope my contradicting or refuting the Matters of Fact ſet forth in this <hi>Citation,</hi> ſhall not be ſo maliciouſly perverted by any, as if I meant to reflect either on His <hi>Majeſty</hi> for writing to his Council of <hi>Scotland,</hi> ordering this <hi>Citation</hi> to be made, or on his <hi>Advocate</hi> for forming it, and iſſuing it out. But as I acknowledg, that upon the <hi>Information</hi> it ſeems was offered of thoſe Matters here laid againſt me, it was very reaſonable for His <hi>Majeſty</hi> to order Juſtice to be done upon me; ſo his <hi>Advocate,</hi> in whoſe hands thoſe <hi>Informations</hi> it ſeems are now put, had all poſſible reaſon to lay them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, as he has done; and therefore I will not pretend to make any Exception to the <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Acts of Parliament,</hi> ſet forth in the firſt part of this <hi>Citation;</hi> but I will only anſwer
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:101251:83"/> the matters of Fact laid to my charge; and whatſoever I ſay concerning them, does only belong to my falſe Accuſers; and therefore I hope they will not be look'd on as things in which even his <hi>Majeſties Advocate,</hi> but much leſs his Sacred <hi>Majeſty,</hi> is any way concerned.</p>
               <p>I am firſt accuſed for having ſeen, converſed with, and held correſpondence with the late <hi>Earl of Argyle:</hi> and to make this appear the more probable; the place is marked very Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically, where I lived; and where, as it is pretended, we met. But it is now almoſt two Years ſince the late <hi>Argyle</hi> was taken and ſuffered, and that a full account was had of all his ſecret Practices, in all which I have not been once ſo much as men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, tho it is now a Year ſince I have lived and preach'd o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly in theſe <hi>Provinces.</hi> The truth is, that for nine Years before the late <hi>Earl of Argiles</hi> forfeiture, I had no ſort of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence with him, nor did I ever ſee him ſince the Year 1676. After his eſcape out of Priſon I never ſaw him, nor writ to him, nor heard from him, nor had I any ſort of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with him, directly nor indirectly: the Circumſtance of my Houſe, and the place in which I lived, is added, to make the thing look ſomewhat probable: but tho it is very eaſy to know where I lived, and I having dwelt in <hi>Lincolns-Inn-Fields</hi> the ſpace of ſeven Years, it was no hard matter to add this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular; yet ſo Inconſiderate is the Malice of my Enemies, that even in this; it leads them out of the way; for ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Argile</hi>'s Eſcape, and during the ſtay that, as is believed, he made in <hi>London,</hi> I had removed from <hi>Lincolns-Inn-Fields</hi> into <hi>Brook-buildings;</hi> this makes me gueſs at the <hi>Informer,</hi> who ſaw me often in the one Houſe, but never in the other: and yet even he, who has betraryed all that ever paſt between us, has not Impudence enough to charge me with the leaſt Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyalty, tho I concealed very few of my thoughts from him.</p>
               <p>With this of my ſeeing the late <hi>Argile,</hi> the <hi>Article</hi> of the Scandalous and Treaſonable words pretended to be ſpoken by me to him, againſt His <hi>Majeſties</hi> Perſon and Government, falls to the ground; it is obvious that this cannot be proved, ſince <hi>Argile</hi> is dead; and it is not pretended that theſe words were uttered in the hearing of other Witneſſes: nor is it needful to add, that His <hi>Majeſty</hi> was then only a Subject, ſo that any
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:101251:84"/> Words ſpoken of him at that time cannot amount to <hi>Treaſon:</hi> but I can appeal to all thoſe with whom I have ever conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, if they have ever heard me fail in the reſpect I owed the <hi>King:</hi> and I can eaſily bring many Witneſſes from ſeveral parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> of the Zeal with which I have on all occaſions expreſſed my ſelf on thoſe Subjects; and that none of all thoſe hard Words, that have been ſo Freely beſtowed on me, has made me forget my Duty in the leaſt.</p>
               <p>I am in the next place accuſed of Correſpondence with <hi>James Stewart,</hi> Mr. <hi>Robert Ferguſon, Thomas Stewart, William Denholm,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Robert Martyn,</hi> ſince my coming out of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> and that I have entertained and ſupplied them in For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Parts; particularly in the Cities of <hi>Amſterdam, Rotter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, Leyden, Breda, Geneva,</hi> or in ſome other parts within the <hi>Netherlands.</hi> This <hi>Article</hi> is ſo very ill laid in all its branches, that it ſhews my Enemies have very ill Informations concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning my moſt general Acquaintance ſince; tho there are, among thoſe that are condemned for Treaſon, ſome that are of my Kindred and ancient Acquaintance; they have here caſt together a Company of Men who are all (<hi>James Stewart</hi> only excepted) abſolutely unknown to me, whom I never ſaw, and with whom I never exchanged one word in my whole life, as far as I can remember; one of them, Mr. <hi>Robert Martyn,</hi> was as I ever underſtood it, dead above a Year before I left <hi>England;</hi> as for <hi>James Stewart,</hi> I had a general Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with him twenty Years ago, but have had no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with him now for many Years, unleſs it was that I ſaw him twice by Accident, and that was ſeveral Years before there was any Sentence paſt on him: my Accuſers know my Motion ill, for I have not been in <hi>Breda</hi> theſe twenty three Years. I ſetled in the <hi>Hague</hi> upon my coming into <hi>Holland,</hi> becauſe I was willing to be under the Obſervation of His <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Envoy:</hi> and I choſe this place the rather, becauſe it was known, that none of thoſe that lay under Sentences come to it. I have never gone to <hi>Amſterdam</hi> or <hi>Rotterdam</hi> in ſecret: and have never been there but upon my private Affairs, and that never above a Night or two at a time; and I have been ſo viſible all the while that I was in thoſe places, that I thought there was not room left even for Calumny.</p>
               <pb n="159" facs="tcp:101251:84"/>
               <p>In the laſt place it is ſaid, that I have <hi>publickly and avowedly uttered ſeveral Speeches and Poſitions to the diſdain of His Majeſties Perſon, Authority and Government, and that I continue and perſiſt in thoſe Treaſonable Practices.</hi> This is ſo generally Aſſerted, that it is enough for me to ſay, it is poſitively falſe: but I have yet clearer Evidence to the contrary of this: I have preached a whole Sermon in the <hi>Hague</hi> againſt all Treaſonable Doctrines and Practices; and in particular, againſt the Lawfulneſs of Subjects riſing in Arms againſt their Soveraign, upon the account of Religion: and I have maintained this ſo oft, both in publick and private, that I could, if I thought it convenient, give Proofs of it that would make all my Enemies be aſhamed of their Injuſtice and Malice.</p>
               <p>The Witneſſes cited againſt me are, firſt, Sir <hi>John Cochran,</hi> whom I have not ſeen above theſe four Years laſt paſt, and with whom I have had no ſort of Commerce ſince I ſaw him. It is almoſt two Years ſince he had his Pardon; ſo it is probable he then told all that he has ever told concerning <hi>me:</hi> and it is not likely, that the Matter would have been let lie aſleep all this while, if he had ſaid any thing to my prejudice. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs I have been long acquainted with him; I look upon him as a Man of Honour; and I reckon my ſelf ſo ſafe in his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and in my own Innocence, that I do very freely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe him from all the Obligations of Friendſhip and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, and wiſh that he may declare every thing that has ever paſt between us; for then I am ſure he will do me the right to own, that as oft as we talk'd of ſome things that were complained of in <hi>Scotland,</hi> I took occaſion to repeat my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Duty of Subjects, to ſubmit and bear all the ill Adminiſtrations that might be in the Government, but never to riſe in Arms upon that account. The next <hi>Witneſs</hi> is his <hi>Son,</hi> whom I never ſaw but once or twice, and with whom I never entred into any Diſcourſe, but what became a Man of my profeſſion to ſo young a Perſon, exhorting him to the Duties of a Chriſtian. The next two are Mr. <hi>Weſt</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bourn,</hi> whoſe Faces I do not know. After them come Mr. <hi>Carſtaires</hi> and Mr. <hi>Baird,</hi> whoſe Faces I know not neither: It ſeems theſe are the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> to be led againſt me for the <hi>Article</hi> relating to the <hi>Netherlands;</hi> but as I am wholly a Stranger to
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:101251:85"/> Mr. <hi>Carſtairs,</hi> ſo I do not ſo much as know if there is ſuch a Perſon in being as <hi>Robert Baird,</hi> Merchant in <hi>Holland.</hi> And for the laſt, Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> I have had no Correſpondence at all with him theſe two and twenty Years; unleſs it was that once or twice I have met him by accident in a Viſit in a third place, and that once about ſix Years ago I went to diſcourſe with him concerning a matter of Hiſtory in which we differ'd; but as all our Converſation at that time was in the preſence of ſome Witneſſes, ſo it was not at all relating to matters of State.</p>
               <p>And now I have gone over all the Matter that is laid againſt me in this <hi>Citation,</hi> and have made ſuch <hi>Reflections</hi> both on the <hi>Facts</hi> that are alledged, and the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> that are named, as will I hope ſatisfy even my Enemies themſelves, of the Falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and Injuſtice of theſe <hi>Informations.</hi> So that I preſume ſo far on His <hi>Majeſty</hi>'s Juſtice, as to expect that all the Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation which is kindled againſt me, will be turned upon my falſe Accuſers.</p>
               <p>To all this I will add one thing further for my Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, tho I am fully ſatisfied it is that which I am not obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to do, and which if I were in other Circumſtances I would not do my ſelf; as I would adviſe no other Man to do it. For it is a part of that Right that every Man to preſerve himſelf by all lawful ways, that he do not accuſe himſelf, and by conſequence, that he do not purge himſelf by <hi>Oath</hi> of matters objected to him: and I do not ſo well approve of the <hi>Courts of Inquiſition,</hi> as to give countenance to a practice which was firſt ſet on foot by them, of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring Men to anſwer upon <hi>Oath</hi> to Matters objected to them. If I were not a <hi>Church-man</hi> I would not do this which I am about to do; as I declare I will never do it again, let my Enemies lay to my charge what they pleaſe. But the regard I have to this <hi>Sacred Function</hi> to which I am de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated, makes me now once for all, offer this ſolemn pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of my ſelf. <hi>I atteſt the Great God, the Searcher of all Things, and the Judg of all Men, that all the Matters of Fact laid to my Charge in this Citation are utterly groundleſs, and ahſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely falſe.</hi> This I am ready to confirm with my Corporal <hi>Oath,</hi> and to receive the <hi>Sacrament</hi> upon it.</p>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:101251:85"/>
               <p>And now I hope I have ſaid enough to ſatisfy His <hi>Majeſty</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning my Innocence, ſo that I am confident he will not only diſcharge all further proceedings againſt me, upon this Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, but that he will expreſs his Royal Diſpleaſure againſt my Falſe Accuſers. But if the power of my Enemies, and their cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit with His <hi>Majeſty</hi> is ſtill ſo great, that this matter ſhall be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried further, and that advantage ſhall be taken from my not appearing in <hi>Scotland,</hi> to proceed to a <hi>Sentence</hi> againſt me, which ſome brutal <hi>men</hi> now in the <hi>Hague</hi> are threatning before hand, that they will execute it: I then make my moſt humble <hi>Appeal</hi> to the Great God, the King of kings, who knows my Innocence, and to whom my Blood will cry for Vengeance, againſt all that may be any way concerned in the ſhedding of it. He will at the Great Day judge all men righteouſly, without reſpect of perſons: It is to him that I fly, who I am ſure will hear me. Judge me, O God, according to the Integrity that is in me.</p>

               <p>THe Copy of the <hi>Citation</hi> againſt me, has been ſent me out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſince I took the liberty to write laſt to your <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip;</hi> this puts me on a ſecond Addreſs to you, for conveying the encloſed <hi>Anſwer,</hi> which I moſt humbly lay down at his <hi>Majeſty's</hi> feet. I am confident that the Falſhood of the matters objected to me, will appear ſo evident to His <hi>Majeſty,</hi> as well as to all the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, that he will not only order the <hi>proceedings</hi> to be quite diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, but that he will alſo order ſome reparation to be made to me, for ſo publick a Blemiſh, as even a <hi>Citation</hi> for ſo high a Crime amounts to. I confeſs the many hard things that have been of late caſt on me, and in particular to Young and Old, and Forraigners as well as <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> that have been coming into theſe Parts, make me ſee that my Enemies have poſſeſſed his <hi>Majeſty</hi> with thoughts of me,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:101251:86"/> that I muſt crave leave with all Humility to ſay, that they are as unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved as hard. What have I either done or ſaid, to draw on me ſo heavy and ſo long a continued diſpleaſure? but my comfort lies in the Witneſs that I have within me, of my own Innocence: ſo that I dare appeal to God, as I do now with all duty to his <hi>Vicegerent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Since this Matter is now become ſo publick, and that my <hi>Name</hi> is now ſo generally known; I muſt not be wanting to my own Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, eſpecially when not only my <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Reputation</hi> are ſtruck at, but the <hi>Religion</hi> that I profeſs is wounded through my ſides: therefore till I have put in order my <hi>Memoirs</hi> for a larger work, I find it in ſome ſort neceſſary to print the <hi>Citation,</hi> together with this <hi>Anſwer:</hi> but I had much rather have all this prevented, by an effect of his <hi>Majeſties Juſtice,</hi> in ordering an end to be put to this Accuſation, and that hy ſome <hi>Act</hi> that may be as publick as the <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> it ſelf was, which may bear His <hi>Majeſty's</hi> being ſatisfied with my Innocence, as to theſe Matters; but if I have still as melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an anſwer to this, as I have had to all the former Applications I have made, I muſt maintain my <hi>Innocence</hi> the beſt way I can, in which I will never forget that vaſt Duty that I owe His <hi>Majeſty,</hi> whatſoever I may meet with in my own particular.</p>
               <p>If there is any thing either in the Incloſed <hi>Paper,</hi> or in this <hi>Letter,</hi> that ſeems a little too vehement, I hope the provocation that I have met with will be likewiſe conſidered; for while my <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> are ſtruck at, and while ſome here are threatning ſo high, a man muſt be forgiven to ſhew that he is not quite unſenſible: tho my Duty to the <hi>King</hi> is Proof againſt all that can ever be done to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke me, yet I muſt be ſuffered to treat the Inſtruments and Procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of my diſgrace, who are contriving my deſtruction, with the plainneſs that ſuch Practices draw from me.

                  <hi>I</hi> Venture once more to renew my Addreſſes to your <hi>Lordſhip,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I <hi>Print</hi> the <hi>Paper</hi> that I ſent you by my laſt of the <hi>17.</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> together with the <hi>Two Letters</hi> that I writ you: for I find it neceſſary to add this, and that it go with the reſt to the Preſs.</p>
               <p>I am told, that great Advantages have been taken upon an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion in my <hi>Firſt Letter,</hi> in which I writ that by <hi>my Naturaliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion during my ſtay here, My Allegiance was tranſlated from His Majeſty to the Soveraignty of this Province;</hi> as if this alone was crime enough: and I hear that ſome who have been of the Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the <hi>Law</hi> are of this Mind. I indeed thought that none who had ever pretended to ſtudy Law, or the general Notions of the Entercourſe among Nations, could miſtake in ſo clear a Point. I cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned my words ſo, as to ſhew that I conſidered this Tranſlation of my <hi>Allegiance</hi> only as a temporary thing <hi>during my ſtay here.</hi> And can any man be ſo ignorant as to doubt of this? <hi>Allegiance</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection</hi> are things by their natures reciprocal: ſince then <hi>Naturaliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> gives a Legal <hi>Protection,</hi> there muſt be a return of <hi>Allegiance</hi> due upon it. I do not deny but the root of Natural <hi>Allegiance</hi> remains, but it is certainly under a ſuſpenſion, while the <hi>Naturalized Perſon</hi> enjoys the Protection of the <hi>Prince</hi> or <hi>State</hi> that has ſo received him. I know what a Crime it had been if I had become <hi>Naturalized</hi> to any <hi>State</hi> in <hi>War</hi> with the <hi>King;</hi> but when it was to a <hi>State</hi> that is in <hi>Alliance</hi> with him, and when it was upon ſo juſt a ground as my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be married and ſetled in this <hi>State,</hi> as it could be no Crime in me to deſire it, ſo I having obtained it, am not a little amazed, to hear that any are ſo little converſant in the Law of Nations, as to take Exceptions at my words. Our Saviour has ſaid, <hi>that a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſerve two Maſters:</hi> and the nature of things ſay, that a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be at the ſame time under two <hi>Allegiances.</hi> His <hi>Majeſty</hi> by Naturalizing the <hi>Earl of Feverſham</hi> and many others of the <hi>French Nation,</hi> knows well what a right this gives him to their <hi>Allegiance,</hi> which no doubt he as well as many others have ſworn, and this is a tranſlating their <hi>Allegiance</hi> with a Witneſs: That <hi>Lord</hi> was to have commanded the <hi>Troops</hi> that were to be ſent into <hi>Flanders</hi>
                  <pb n="168" facs="tcp:101251:87"/> in <hi>1678.</hi> against his Natural <hi>Prince:</hi> and yet tho' the <hi>Laws of France</hi> are high enough upon the points of <hi>Soveraignty,</hi> it was never ſo much as pretended that this was a Crime. And it is ſo much the Intereſt of all <hi>Princes</hi> to aſſure themſelves of thoſe whom they receive into their Protection by <hi>Naturalizing</hi> them (ſince without that they ſhould give Protection to ſo many Spies and Agents for another Prince) that if I had not very good ground to aſſure me, that ſome have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to make a Crime out of my Words, I could not eaſily believe it.</p>

               <head>ADVERTISEMENT.</head>
               <p>WHen I had reſolved on the <hi>Printing</hi> theſe <hi>Papers,</hi> and was waiting till the day ſhould come to which I was cited, I received a new <hi>Advertiſement,</hi> that the firſt <hi>Citation</hi> was let fall, and that I was cited of new to the 15 of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> to Anſwer to the Crimes of <hi>High Treaſon,</hi> upon the account of <hi>two Heads</hi> in my firſt <hi>Letter</hi> to the Earl of <hi>Middletoune:</hi> The one is, that I ſay, that <hi>by my Naturalization I am looſed from any Allegiance to His Majeſty;</hi> and the other is, that I threaten <hi>His Majeſty</hi> with the <hi>Printing and Diſcovering of Secrets that have been long hid.</hi> If after what I have hitherto met with, there were room left for new Surpriſes, this would have been a very great one. Thoſe who have adviſed the <hi>King</hi> to this way of Proceeding againſt me, ſhew that they conſider very little the Reputation of His <hi>Majeſty</hi>'s <hi>Juſtice;</hi> and ſo I be but Sacrificed, they do not care how much the <hi>Kings Honour</hi> ſuffers in it: for <hi>Firſt,</hi> after a <hi>Citation</hi> of <hi>High Treaſon,</hi> which has made ſo much noiſe, <hi>that is let fall:</hi> Which is plainly to confeſs, that there is no truth in all thoſe Matters that were laid to my Charge; and then, where is the Juſtice of this way of Proceeding, to Summon a Man to appear upon the pretence of Crimes, of which they know him to be Innocent? But this new mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is of ſuch a Nature, that it is not eaſy for me to find words ſoft enough to ſpeak of it with the decency that becomes me.</p>
               <p>This is now more the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of the <hi>States of Holland and Weſt-Friezeland</hi> than it is mine. It is indeed the Cauſe of all the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigns in the World, and ſo it is His <hi>Majeſties</hi> own Cauſe, who has ſo often called the Naturalized <hi>French His Subjects,</hi> and by conſequence they owe him an <hi>Allegiance;</hi> and ſo here muſt be at leaſt a Temporary <hi>Tranſlation of their Allegiance made to him from their Natural Prince:</hi> And either this muſt be the ſame as to thoſe who are <hi>Naturalized</hi> by the <hi>States</hi> here, or they are not a Soveraign State, and by conſequence this Cauſe is <hi>theirs,</hi> and not <hi>mine;</hi> ſince the Crime of which I am now accuſed is the acknowledging my ſelf to have become
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:101251:88"/> 
                  <hi>their Subject during my ſtay here,</hi> upon their having granted me the Benefit and Protection of <hi>Naturalization;</hi> ſo that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther His <hi>Majeſty</hi> was much miſtaken in calling the <hi>French</hi> that are Naturalized <hi>His Subjects;</hi> or it can be no Crime in me to have owned my ſelf to have become a <hi>Temporary Subject</hi> to the <hi>States.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if thoſe who have ſtudied the <hi>Roman Law</hi> will reflect a little on the Effects that belonged to the <hi>(Jus Civitatis)</hi> or the Rights that followed on the being made a <hi>Roman Citizen,</hi> which are the ſame in all Sovereign <hi>States,</hi> and that <hi>Natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lization</hi> is with regard to a <hi>Prince</hi> or <hi>State</hi> that which <hi>Adoption</hi> was by the <hi>Roman Law</hi> with regard to private <hi>Families,</hi> they will ſee that my Enemies do not reflect enough on the Principles of Law, when they pretend to make me a Criminal upon ſuch an account. If I had been charged for having deſired to be <hi>Naturalized,</hi> I confeſs there had been ſome more Colour for it: but ſince it is now a received Practice over all <hi>Europe,</hi> for the <hi>Subjects</hi> of one <hi>State</hi> to procure their being <hi>Naturalized</hi> in another; it is unaccountable how any can call in queſtion that tye of <hi>Allegiance,</hi> that he who is <hi>Naturalized</hi> owes to his New Maſters. Nor have my Enemies conſidered how much this way of Proceeding againſt me, muſt ſink the Credit of His <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Naturalizing Strangers:</hi> For how can they expect a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Protection from him, if it is made apparent that the <hi>King</hi> does not think he has a right to their <hi>Allegiance?</hi> And into what a Conſternation muſt it throw them, when they find by <hi>my Caſe</hi> that the <hi>King</hi> looks upon them as ſo many <hi>Traytors</hi> for becoming his <hi>Subjects,</hi> and for ſwearing <hi>Allegiance</hi> to him? For that <hi>Oath</hi> is ſworn in terms that are plain and full, and that have not the Qualification that I put in my words, of <hi>during my ſtay here;</hi> ſo that they are much more Criminal than it can be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that I am.</p>
               <p>The other <hi>Article</hi> is no leſs Injurious to His <hi>Majeſty,</hi> ſince they would make a Crime out of my Words, that mention my Fear that he may be diſpleaſed at ſome things that may be in the <hi>Apology,</hi> that I will be obliged to make for my ſelf, to the <hi>Writing</hi> and <hi>Printing</hi> of which a Sentence againſt me will drive me. If theſe Men, who have adviſed this, had the regard to his <hi>Majeſty,</hi> which they owe him, they would not
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:101251:88"/> have preſumed to infer, that it was a Threatning of His <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,</hi> when I ſay, that I muſt juſtify my ſelf; or that any <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory</hi> of paſt Tranſactions can be a want of Duty to him; this Conſequence of theirs Intimates that his <hi>Life,</hi> or the late <hi>King</hi> his <hi>Brothers,</hi> cannot bear a true Hiſtory, otherwiſe where is the threatning? But how great a Crime this is, will I hope ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to His <hi>Majeſty,</hi> when he has the leiſure to reflect upon it; yet there may be many particulars that I muſt neceſſarily bring in, in the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> that I am writing, which have ſuch a Connexion with what relates to my ſelf, that I cannot paſs them by; which yet if it could be avoided, may not be fit for publick View. Now if my Enemies fancy, that is is a Crime for me to juſtify my ſelf, becauſe they have poſſeſſed His <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty</hi> againſt me; I could anſwer this with ſome famed ſayings of <hi>Tacitus</hi>'s, that would diſturb them a little; and if in an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Groan that I make before His <hi>Majeſty,</hi> I mention this as a Conſideration that may be of ſome weight with him; they who can turn this Expreſſion of my Duty and Reſpect into a Crime, and are ſucceſsful in the Attempt, have a Talent for which I do not envy them, tho I my ſelf come to feel the weight of it.</p>

            <head>Dr. <hi>BURNET</hi>'s Vindication of <hi>Himſelf</hi> from the Calumnies with which he is aſperſed, In a <hi>Pamphlet,</hi> entituled, <hi>Parliamentum Pacificum.</hi> Licenſed by the Earl of <hi>Sunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and Printed at <hi>London</hi> in <hi>March, 1688.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>A Silence for ſo many Months, in which my Name has been ſo much toſſed in Libels, as well as in Gazettes, has ſhewed the World, with how much uneaſineſs I am drawn to ſay any thing in my own Defence, when ſo <hi>ſacred a Name</hi> has been made uſe of to give an Authority to what has been ſaid or done againſt me: A Chriſtian cannot fail when he goes by ſo Divine a Pattern as our Saviour himſelf has ſet the World. He, when he was accuſed, for a great while <hi>anſwered not a word;</hi> yet at laſt being required to do it by the High Prieſt, he ſpoke for himſelf: <hi>But when he was reviled, he reviled not again.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In an humble Imitation of that Example, as I will return no reviling Words, for all thoſe that are ſo liberally thrown out upon me; ſo the Juſtifying of my ſelf, being now become an Apology for the Protection that is granted me by the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> (whoſe Subject I am) as well as for my ſelf, I am in ſome ſort forced again to appear in my own Defence. If this Pamphlet had not carried ſuch a Licenſe as it has in its Front; and if the <hi>States</hi> had not been worſe uſed in it, than I my ſelf am, I had paſſed over all the Malice that is in it, with the ſame Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence that I have ſhewed on other occaſions. But it being judged neceſſary that I ſhould plead my own Cauſe a little, ſince the <hi>Protection</hi> that the <hi>States</hi> give me, has made it now likewiſe theirs, and that it may appear that they have no juſt Reaſon to be aſhamed of me, I ſhall Anſwer all that relates to my ſelf, except the foul Language that is in it. But I will repeat nothing that was in the <hi>Paper</hi> that I publiſht laſt <hi>June:</hi> in
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:101251:89"/> which I ſet down the firſt <hi>Citation,</hi> together with the <hi>Anſwer</hi> that I made to it, and my Letters to the Earl of <hi>Middletoune,</hi> together with ſome Reflections upon the whole Matter; ſo I offer this only as a Supplement to that Paper.</p>
            <p>I will begin with ſetting down the ſecond <hi>Citation,</hi> after I have made this ſhort Remark on the firſt, That thoſe very Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, for converſing with whom, I was accuſed in it, being now pardoned, and in <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Government <hi>there,</hi> has a ſure means in their hands, to know the Falſhood of that Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: ſo that thoſe who offered thoſe Informations againſt me, which gave the riſe to all that has ſince followed, ought to be lookt on as <hi>Calumniators,</hi> and to be puniſhed accordingly: and if any ill choſen Expreſſion had fallen from me in the Letter that I writ to the Earl of <hi>Middletoune,</hi> the Privacy of the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the Reſpect that was in it, and the Provocation that drew it from me, (an Accuſation of High Treaſon, which is now evidently made out to be a Calumny) all theſe, I ſay, give me ſome reaſon to conclude, that if a ſecret Animoſity of ſome of my Enemies that have abuſed their Credit with the King to my Prejudice, had not wrought more than a regard to <hi>Juſtice,</hi> there had not been a ſecond Proſecution, when the firſt was found to be ſo ill grounded, that they were forced to let it fall. The <hi>Citation</hi> is in theſe Words.</p>

            <p>After this follows the form of Law ordinary in ſuch Citati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, by which I am required to appear on the 9th day of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt,</hi> in order to my Tryal, which was to be ſix days after that, under the Pains of being declared a <hi>Rebel,</hi> and a <hi>Fugitive;</hi> and all bears date the 10th of <hi>June,</hi> 1687.</p>
            <p>I ſhall offer only two Exceptions to this, in point of Form; 1ſt, there is no <hi>Special Law</hi> ſet forth here, upon which I am to be <hi>Judged;</hi> which, as I am informed by thoſe who underſtand the <hi>Law of Scotland,</hi> makes the Citation <hi>null</hi> in point of Form,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:101251:91"/> ſince <hi>High Treaſon</hi> is a Crime of ſuch a Nature, that no Man can be concluded Guilty of it, but upon a ſpecial Law. 2dly, In Criminal matters, no Proofs of any Writing upon the Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Hands, are ſo much as admitted by the Law of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> ſo that all ſuch Proofs are only General Preſumptions; and therefore, ſince there is no other Proof that can be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in this caſe; it is not poſſible according to the grounds and practice of the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Law, to find me Guilty upon this <hi>Citation.</hi> Upon my not appearance on the 9th day of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> the matter was for ſome time delayed. At laſt a <hi>Writ</hi> was iſſued out againſt me, called in the Law of <hi>Scotland, Letters of Horning,</hi> becauſe they are publiſhed with the blaſt of a <hi>Horn;</hi> in which I am declared the King's <hi>Rebel;</hi> but this is not iſſued out upon the account of the <hi>Matter</hi> of the Citation, of which no Cognizance has been taken: But only for my not appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to offer my ſelf to <hi>Tryal;</hi> and the Operation of this in Law, is only the putting me out of the <hi>King's Protection,</hi> and the preſent Seizing on my perſonal Eſtate, and after a year, the Seizing any thing that I enjoy for <hi>Term of Life;</hi> but this Writ does neither affect my <hi>Life,</hi> nor my <hi>Poſterity,</hi> nor can an <hi>Eſtate of Inheritance</hi> be ſo much as <hi>Confiſcated</hi> by it; and tho the term <hi>Rebel</hi> is put in it, that word is only a <hi>Form of Law;</hi> for every man that does not pay his Debts is liable to ſuch a <hi>Writ,</hi> and he is declared the <hi>King's Rebel,</hi> juſt as the <hi>Chancery</hi> in <hi>England</hi> iſſues out a <hi>Writ of Rebellion</hi> upon Contempts; ſo that if the being called a <hi>Rebel</hi> in ſuch a <hi>Writ,</hi> gives the Government a right to demand me, then every Man that retires into <hi>Holland,</hi> either out of <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Scotland,</hi> upon the account of a diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in his Affairs, may be demanded as ſoon as any ſuch Writ goes out againſt him.</p>
            <p>As for the matter of this <hi>Citation,</hi> I ſaid ſo much upon it in my former <hi>Paper,</hi> that ſince no Anſwer has been made to that, I do not think it neceſſary to ſay any more than what will oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur to me in the account of the Progreſs of this Affair. Mr. <hi>d' Albeville</hi> his Majeſties Envoy, did in the Month of <hi>July</hi> laſt, put in a <hi>Memorial</hi> againſt me, which being already in <hi>Print,</hi> I ſhall only offer here the abſtract of it. <hi>In the Preamble it ſets forth, That whereas I had obtained Letters of Burgerſhip in the Town of</hi> Amſterdam: <hi>In the Vertue thereof, theſe Letters being
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:101251:91"/> preſented to the States of</hi> Holland, <hi>by the ſaid Town, I had obtained the Protection of the States: with which I was not ſatisfied, but by my Libels I defamed the King and his Government: of which it of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered two Inſtances: one, that I repreſented my ſelf as Perſecuted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account of Religion: which was ſo falſe, that all Religions were tolerated by the King. The other was, that I pretended that my life was in danger: for which, If I had any grounds, I ought to have repreſented it to the King's Miniſters in</hi> England, <hi>or to his Miniſter bere: and that it was Notorious that the greateſt of all Criminals were in ſafety here, for fear to draw upon themſelves his Majeſties diſpleaſure: who abhors ſuch practices, tho by the King's Laws eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of his ſubjects was warranted to ſeiſe on them here, in what manner ſoever.</hi> Upon all which it concluded, <hi>That the States ought to puniſh both me and my Printer, without naming him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I hope I may without being wanting to the reſpect due to his Character, make ſome obſervations on this. It is well known, that I was never made <hi>Burgeſs of Amſterdam;</hi> ſo that all the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amble falls; and it appears, that the <hi>Envoy</hi> has not taken the pains that forraign Miniſters ordinarily do, to be rightly infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of this matter, when he began to move in it. I applied my ſelf immediately to the <hi>States of Holland,</hi> in order to my being <hi>Naturalized,</hi> and in my Petition I ſet forth the Reaſon of it, which ever ſince <hi>Solons Laws,</hi> has been thought the juſteſt ground for it, and that was a <hi>Marriage,</hi> and this was no pretended colour, for I was <hi>contracted</hi> the ſame day. I had lived before that, a year at the <hi>Hague,</hi> and I ſaw clearly a ſtorm coming upon me, yet I had uſed no precaution to cover my ſelf from it: but when a <hi>Marriage</hi> and a ſettlement in <hi>Holland,</hi> made it neceſſary for me to deſire the Rights and Priviledges of the Countrey, it cannot be thought ſtrange if I petitioned for it: and the <hi>States,</hi> who know how long I had both lived and preached publickly at the <hi>Hague,</hi> under the eyes of two of the Kings Miniſters, one after another, ſaw no ſort of reaſon, ſo much as to deliberate upon my petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but granted it to me as a <hi>thing of courſe:</hi> As for the matter that His Majeſties <hi>Envoy</hi> objected to me, I ſaid nothing in the paper I printed but what plainly contradicts the firſt point: my words relating to it are, <hi>that it is yet too early to ſet on a Perſecution for matters of Religion, and therefore Crimes againſt the State muſt be pretended and faſtned on thoſe whom theſe men intend to deſtroy.</hi>
               <pb n="178" facs="tcp:101251:92"/> Now it is plain, that by <hi>theſe men,</hi> I intend <hi>thoſe</hi> who had Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med againſt me, the matters that are in the firſt <hi>Citation;</hi> and that being let fall as a <hi>Calumny,</hi> too groſs to be any longer ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, I had all reaſon to paſs that cenſure on <hi>theſe men.</hi> But theſe words cannot be ſuppoſed to have any relation to the <hi>King,</hi> unleſs in that part of them, that it is yet <hi>too early to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute for matters of Religion,</hi> which import that <hi>my Enemies</hi> dare not attempt to carry his Majeſty to that; ſo that this period in my paper is evidently contrary to the Inference that is drawn from it.</p>
            <p>The 2d point is no better grounded: ſince I publiſhed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing relating to the <hi>Danger</hi> in which I <hi>was,</hi> but my <hi>Letters</hi> to the Earl of <hi>Middleton;</hi> ſo that I had begun my Complaints to him, but I was never encouraged to go to the naming of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars. As for that period, that the <hi>greateſt of Criminals are here ſafe from ſuch Attempts, for fear of drawing upon themſelves the King's diſpleaſure:</hi> (de peur de s'attirer) certainly the <hi>Envoy</hi> was in haſte, when he drew it, for the want of a <hi>clear ſenſe in it,</hi> is ſuch, that it cannot be carried off by an Ignorance of the <hi>French tongue,</hi> ſince ſure thoſe Criminals are not afraid to <hi>Draw upon themſelves the King's diſpleaſure by attempting on themſelves.</hi> So that ſome ſuch words as theſe <hi>(all his Majesties good ſubjects avoiding ſuch prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices, for fear of drawing upon themſelves his Diſpleaſure)</hi> muſt be ſuppoſed to make the period <hi>Clear ſenſe.</hi> But if I had any apprehenſions of <hi>Danger</hi> before this <hi>Memorial,</hi> they are juſtly encreaſed by it; ſince the <hi>Envoy</hi> concludes the paragraph, by ſaying, <hi>that every one of the King's ſubjects were warranted by his Laws to ſeiſe on ſuch here in what manner ſoever</hi> (a s'y emparer en quelque maniere que ce ſoit) <hi>in what manner ſoever</hi> does al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, on ſuch occaſions, ſignifie either <hi>Dead</hi> or <hi>Alive.</hi> Now when the Kings <hi>Envoy</hi> did in a <hi>Memorial</hi> to the <hi>States,</hi> which was afterwards <hi>printed,</hi> aſſert that this was <hi>Law,</hi> It is eaſy to Infer from hence, what juſt apprehenſions this might ſuggeſt to me. As for his deſire to have me <hi>Puniſhed</hi> for that Libel; he did in that Appeal which he made to the Juſtice of the <hi>States,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge me to be their <hi>Subject:</hi> but if I have by printing of that or any other Paper, made my ſelf liable to the puniſhment of the <hi>States,</hi> the Complaint ought to have been made in the form of Law, to the <hi>Court of Holland,</hi> as it would be in <hi>England</hi> to
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:101251:92"/> the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> ſince the <hi>States</hi> themſelves do not not enter into the proſecutions of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and to that <hi>Court</hi> I moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſubmit my ſelf, and acknowledg, that if I cannot juſtify my ſelf of every thing that can be laid to my Charge, they ought to puniſh me with the utmoſt ſeverity of <hi>Juſtice.</hi> Since a man of my <hi>Profeſſion,</hi> as he ought to be an <hi>Example</hi> for his good beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, ſo he ought to be made an Example of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> when he brings himſelf within the compaſs of the Law.</p>
            <p>This was the firſt ſtep that was made in my affair, which lay in this ſtate till the <hi>Envoy</hi>'s return from <hi>England</hi> in <hi>December</hi> laſt; upon which he gave in a long Memorial, of which I was made one Article. He ſet forth, <hi>that I being now Judged a Rebel and Fugitive in Scotland, the States were bound to deliver me up, or to baniſh me out of their Dominions, and ſo he demanded that this might be executed.</hi> Upon this I was called before ſome of the Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the <hi>States:</hi> and both the Envoys <hi>Memorials</hi> being read to me, I was required to offer what I had to ſay upon them. I could not but firſt take notice of the great difference that was between them: The <hi>firſt</hi> complaining of me as a <hi>ſubject of the States,</hi> and demanding that I might <hi>be puniſhed</hi> by them; and the <hi>ſecond</hi> demanding me as the <hi>King's Subject.</hi> To the <hi>firſt,</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered according to the Reflections that I have already menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned. To the <hi>ſecond,</hi> I ſaid, I could not be a <hi>Fugitive,</hi> ſince I had come out of <hi>Scotland</hi> fourteen years ago, and after eleven years ſtay in <hi>England,</hi> had come out of it three years ago by the <hi>King's leave.</hi> As for my being a <hi>Rebel;</hi> I could anſwer no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to that, till I ſaw the Judgment that had paſſed upon me: but I was now the <hi>Subject of the States,</hi> and as I humbly claimed their <hi>Protection,</hi> ſo I pretended to no <hi>Protection</hi> againſt <hi>Juſtice:</hi> but offered my ſelf to a Tryal, if any thing was laid to my charge. This being reported to the <hi>States of Holland,</hi> they were ſo far ſatisfied with my Anſwer, that the ſubſtance of it was put in the form of an <hi>Anſwer</hi> to the two <hi>Memorials:</hi> The whole a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to this, <hi>that I was become their ſubject by being naturalized before this proceſs was begun againſt me: ſo that I am now under their Protection: But if there is any thing to be objected to me, that can bear a Tryal, they will give order that full and ſpeedy Juſtice ſhall be done upon it, in the Court of Holland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon this a 3d Memorial was given in, to which the <hi>Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi>
               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:101251:93"/> of the <hi>Treaty</hi> between the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>States,</hi> were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed, relating to <hi>Fugitives</hi> and <hi>Rebels;</hi> and it was ſaid in it, that the <hi>States</hi> were bound to execute theſe with relation to me, without taking upon them to examine the grounds upon which the ſentence was paſt. And becauſe here lies the ſtrength of the whole matter, I ſhall offer ſuch Conſiderations upon it, as will, I hope ſatisfie all perſons. 1. No Sentence is either paſſed or produced againſt me; for I am not declared by any Judgment either Rebel or Fugitive; and by the 7th Article all <hi>Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> ought to be notified by <hi>publick and Authentical letters:</hi> which muſt be underſtood of a <hi>Record of the ſentence,</hi> that ought to be produced: whereas there is nothing ſhewed in my caſe but only a <hi>Memorial.</hi> 2. All Treaties, eſpecially in the <hi>odious parts</hi> of them, are to be underſtood according to the common acceptation of the terms contained in them, and not according to the particular forms of any Courts of Juſtice; the common acceptance of <hi>Fugitive,</hi> is a <hi>man that flies away after a crime committed, from the proſecution of Juſtice;</hi> and a <hi>Rebel</hi> in the common acceptation, is a <hi>man that has born Arms againſt his Prince:</hi> ſince then I am not ſo much as charged with either of theſe, I cannot be comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the Article of the Treaty; for this muſt be the only ſenſe, according to which the <hi>States</hi> are bound to deny harbour to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared <hi>Rebels and Fugitives.</hi> 3. That which puts an end to the whole matter is, that before I writ that Letter, upon which I am now proſecuted; I was become a <hi>Subject of the States,</hi> and by Conſequence was no more in a Capacsty to be either the King's <hi>Rebel</hi> or Fugitive. And the point of <hi>Naturalizing Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,</hi> is now ſuch an univerſal Practice, that the right of gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it, is inſeperable from <hi>Soveraign Power:</hi> ſo that either the <hi>States</hi> have this Right, or they are no more a <hi>Free and Soveraign State.</hi> And the obligations of honour that all <hi>Soveraigns</hi> come under to protect thoſe whom they <hi>naturalize,</hi> againſt every thing but their own <hi>Juſtice,</hi> is no dark point of Law, but is that which every <hi>Prince</hi> knows and practices as oft as there is occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for it. The King of <hi>France</hi> has uſed all the <hi>Naturalized Srangers</hi> in the ſame manner that he has uſed his own ſubjects in the point of <hi>Religion:</hi> and tho the <hi>French Proteſtants,</hi> that are gone into <hi>England,</hi> are according to the ſeverity of the <hi>Edicts</hi>
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:101251:93"/> paſſed againſt them, made <hi>Criminals</hi> for flying out of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; ſo that according to the Letter of thoſe Edicts they are <hi>Fugitives,</hi> yet the King has received them all, owned them for his Subjects, <hi>naturaliſed</hi> ſome, and ſupplied others of them, by a Bounty truly worthy of ſo great a <hi>Prince;</hi> and if the <hi>King</hi> does this to thoſe of another <hi>Religion,</hi> that do fly out of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions of a Prince, with whom he is in peace, The <hi>States</hi> could not with any colour of reaſon, refuſe to <hi>Naturaliſe</hi> me who am of their own Religion, when after ſo long a ſtay among them, it appeared that the King had nothing ro lay to my charge; and they having <hi>Naturaliſed</hi> me, if they ſhould with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw their Protection, before I had forfeited it by any illegal Action of mine, they ſhould make a Breach upon the <hi>Publick Liberty,</hi> upon which their Government is chiefly founded. And it is to be obſerved, that the <hi>Treaty</hi> between the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>them,</hi> as to the Articles concerning <hi>Rebels</hi> and <hi>Fugitives,</hi> is <hi>Reciprocal;</hi> as all the Ancient Treaties between the <hi>Crown</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and the <hi>Princes</hi> of theſe <hi>Provinces,</hi> before the formation of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, ever were as to this particular; ſo that they can be no more bound to the King by it, than the King is bound to them. Now let us ſuppoſe that the King <hi>Naturaliſes</hi> a Dutchman, by which he is admitted to all the Priviledges of an <hi>Engliſhman;</hi> if the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſhould after that condemn this perſon, as guilty of <hi>Rebellion;</hi> the King could not upon the <hi>States</hi> demanding of him, deliver him up or baniſh him at his pleaſure, ſince this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be done arbitrarily to any <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> without a <hi>legal tryal</hi> by his <hi>Peers;</hi> and therefore it is plain that my caſe does not at all fall within the Articles of the Treaty; ſo that in this whole matter the <hi>States</hi> have acted as a free State, that was careful to maintain its <hi>Honour,</hi> and to aſſert its being an <hi>Independent Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty:</hi> and for my own part, I can appeal to all the Members of the <hi>States</hi> of <hi>Holland,</hi> if I made any applications to them, as if I would value my ſelf on my being ſupported in oppoſition to the <hi>Envoy</hi>'s <hi>Memorial;</hi> I ſtaid at home, while the thing was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der conſultation, without making Addreſſes to any one of them as to my own particular. It is true, I would not withdraw of my own accord, from my own houſe, which I thought would have been a forſaking the Rights of the Countrey, a miſtruſting the Protection of my <hi>Soveraigns,</hi> as well as my own Innocence,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:101251:94"/> and an abandoning of the <hi>poſt</hi> in which God by his Providence has placed me. And I am reſolved rather to run the riſque of all <hi>that</hi> with which I am threatned, than ſhow the leaſt unbeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming fear. I thank God I make uſe of that common but Noble expreſſion, that <hi>I am neither afraid to dye, nor aſhamed to live.</hi> I will not go further into dark thoughts, tho I know enough of of the contrivances againſt me, by an <hi>order of men,</hi> whoſe ſouls are as black as their Habits. Tho for a great while I thought that the meanneſs of my perſon was ſuch, that even ſucceſs in any deſign againſt me could not have counterballanced the Infamy of it.</p>
            <p>Thus I hope thoſe hard words of <hi>high treaſon</hi> or <hi>Rebellion</hi> will make no impreſſions on any to my prejudice: for it is with them, as with <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> or <hi>Hereſy</hi> which are very odious words; but if mens paſſions carry them to apply theſe to the moſt Innocent things, they loſe that force which is in them, and this will make the ancient obſervation return into mens minds, that Treaſon was become the crime of thoſe <hi>(qui ab omni crimine innoxii erant)</hi> who were free from all <hi>crimes:</hi> ſo when all this proſecution is ſo ſlightly founded, I make no doubt the world will do me Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice in it; and I can as little doubt, that if my cauſe could be ſo fairly repreſented to His Majeſty, that he might ſee it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thoſe falſe colours with which the Malice of my Enemies dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it. He who has of <hi>late</hi> ſhewed a diſpoſition to receive even into his favour thoſe who were formerly eſteemed, both his <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> Enemies, his <hi>Brothers</hi> and his <hi>own,</hi> would return to juſter and ſofter thoughts of me. For ſince I have done nothing that deſerves his <hi>diſpleaſure,</hi> it would be a greater crime, than any of which I ſtand accuſed, to think that it would be laſting.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Author</hi> lays ſeveral <hi>Papers</hi> to my charge, but he does not prove that they were writ by me: and I do not think my ſelf obliged to ſatisfie every ſpiteful man, that will faſten all ſuch things upon me, as he thinks will render me <hi>odious.</hi> I did ſolemnly purge my ſelf of the matters laid to my charge in the firſt <hi>Citation:</hi> but I ſaid then, that I would not give my Enemies the ſatisfaction of doing <hi>that</hi> any more; or of clearing my ſelf, as oft as they ſhould think fit to lay any thing to my charge; ſo when there is any thing brought againſt me in a legal way, I make no doubt but that I ſhall be able either to <hi>clear my ſelf of it,</hi> or
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:101251:94"/> to <hi>juſtifie my ſelf in it;</hi> But ſince this <hi>Author</hi> thought fit to faſten ſo many Papers on me which I have not <hi>owned,</hi> he ſhould in common equity and decency, have taken ſome notice of a <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe</hi> which I have <hi>owned:</hi> and that was my <hi>Preface</hi> to <hi>Lactan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius's book of the Death of the Perſecutors;</hi> in which I pleaded againſt Perſecution; perhaps with more force than moſt of thoſe who have of late undertaken the Argument: I carried the point ſo far, as to include <hi>even</hi> the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> in that <hi>General Toleration</hi> which I recommended. This I had writ be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore either the King's <hi>Declaration</hi> appeared, or that the procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings againſt me were begun; but tho the ſtate of <hi>Affairs</hi> with relation to my ſelf, was upon that altered, and the point was ſo <hi>tender,</hi> that I had reaſon to apprehend it might offend many of my <hi>Brethren</hi> and <hi>beſt Friends,</hi> at a time when I had no Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to make <hi>Enemies</hi> to my ſelf; yet I publiſhed it, without al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering it in any one thing. In the circumſtances in which I was, I could do nothing more to ſhew how far I was from deſiring to Imbroil matters, than when I touched ſo nice a matter, with ſo much <hi>plainneſs.</hi> As for all the other Reproaches with which he purſues me, I think it below me to anſwer ſuch a Scribler; but for the ſake of the <hi>Licenſe,</hi> I take the liberty to ſay, That I am not afraid, neither of the <hi>Calumnies,</hi> nor the <hi>Violences</hi> of my Enemies. I lived many Years in <hi>England</hi> under a great deal of diſpleaſure from the <hi>Court,</hi> and yet there never was found the leaſt appearance of any <hi>Guilt</hi> in me, with relation to the <hi>Government.</hi> Many of my friends have had <hi>pardons,</hi> and by conſequence did very probably diſcover all they knew of me: for I have been credibly Informed that many have been Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogated, and ſome under <hi>Torture</hi> with relation to me: but there never appeared the leaſt ſhadow of a guilty Compliance with ill, Principles: not only was I free from acceſſion to <hi>ill things,</hi> I was free alſo even from faults of <hi>Omiſſion,</hi> with relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the <hi>Publick;</hi> for I never failed as oft as I ſaw the leaſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for it, to bear down all things that tended to diſturb the <hi>Publick Peace,</hi> and this both in <hi>Books,</hi> in <hi>Sermons,</hi> and in <hi>private Converſation:</hi> and I have Compurgators in this matter, that are <hi>beyond exception,</hi> as well as <hi>above Scandal.</hi> I do not carry this matter further; tho I could ſay that which might cover all my Enemies with <hi>Shame:</hi> and which will perhaps apppear to their
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:101251:95"/> amaſement when they may have put an end to my being in this world.</p>
            <p>I have ever gone by the Principles in which I was bred up at firſt, under a Father that from firſt to laſt, adhered to the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Cauſe,</hi> without ſo much as one ſtumble, or making even an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs of Civility to his Enemies: but was as much an Enemy to <hi>Arbitrary Power,</hi> as he was to <hi>Rebellion,</hi> and thought it was as baſe and unwarrantable a thing, for <hi>Subjects</hi> to give up their juſt and legal <hi>Rights,</hi> as it was for them to fly out upon every pretended violation of them. In theſe Principles I have fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my ſelf, by ſtudy and obſervation; and I may <hi>Love</hi> them, for they have ſtood me very <hi>Dear.</hi> I went no further than to aſſert an <hi>Obedience</hi> and <hi>ſubmiſſion</hi> according to <hi>law,</hi> when I was Imployed to aſſert the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> againſt thoſe who ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to overturn them, in which it was thought I did the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment ſome ſervice, and for which the late <hi>King</hi> was pleaſed to thank me. It is true, I never could deſcend to the Methods of aſpiring to <hi>Preferment</hi> that are expected in ſome <hi>Courts:</hi> but if this made ſome look on me as <hi>ſullen</hi> or <hi>affected,</hi> yet it might have freed me from the Imputations of being <hi>Malecontent,</hi> when there are many Vouchers for me, who know that I avoided all <hi>Preferment</hi> as Induſtriouſly, as the moſt ambitious do court it. I came under ill Characters both in the <hi>Court,</hi> and elſewhere, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe firſt and laſt I was always againſt the <hi>Proſecution of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters:</hi> and I always thought that greater endeavours ought to have been uſed for the Compoſing of the ſmall Differences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong our ſelves, and that greater gentleneſs ought to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed even to thoſe who could not be brought within any terms of reconciliation. Theſe were my only <hi>Crimes</hi> and <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies;</hi> and for theſe Opinions I was repreſented as a favourer of the <hi>Kings</hi> and the <hi>Churches</hi> Enemies. And therefore it cannot but ſeem ſtrange, that I, who was hardly uſed upon thoſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, ſhould be now ſingled out to be the chief Inſtance of an unrelenting ſeverity. The deſigns againſt my <hi>Perſon</hi> ſeem not enough to ſatisfie that <hi>Malice</hi> that works ſo quick a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, but they muſt laſh out on my <hi>good name,</hi> and my Reputation, which I confeſs is the greater tryal of the two to my <hi>Patience:</hi> but tho with relation to <hi>God</hi> I muſt lay my hand on my mouth, and ſay, that <hi>I am the Chief of ſinners;</hi> yet as to all
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:101251:95"/> men, I may boldly ſay, <hi>What have I done?</hi> I hope God will not lay to the Charge of my Enemies, all thoſe Slanders, and all that Injuſtice with which they have proſecuted me.</p>
            <p>This Author and ſome others have often given it out, as if I had <hi>Betrayed a Maſter;</hi> and I may expect the next time, that they will ſay, that I <hi>Murdered my Father;</hi> for the one is as true as the other. I never had a <hi>Maſter</hi> but the <hi>King,</hi> for the whole courſe of my Life raiſed me above the <hi>ſerving of any Subject.</hi> A deſign propoſed to me, by one that is now Dead, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhall not be named by me, of bringing in an <hi>Army</hi> out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> for the Spoiling and Subduing of <hi>England,</hi> gave me a juſt horror at the Propoſition, and I did all I could to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it. The ſame <hi>great Perſon</hi> did quickly take up ſuch a Jealouſy of me, that he did all he could to ruin me, tho His preſent Majeſty, who had then the <hi>Goodneſs</hi> for me to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to Pacify him, owned to me that he could ſee nothing in his hatred of me, but a violent Paſſion: Yet he was reſolved to throw me in a Priſon, where very probably I had languiſhed away the reſt of my Life, if the <hi>King</hi> that now is, had not been ſo gracious to me, as to warn me of my Danger, which made me leave <hi>Scotland;</hi> and after I had ſuffered near two years, all that <hi>Wrath</hi> armed with <hi>Power,</hi> could do to me; at laſt, while I was under one of the ſharp effects of that great Miniſter's anger, I told a Perſon of Honour that which I believed was one of the grounds of it. The Gentleman ſet this ſo about, that as he himſelf was a Member of the <hi>Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> ſo it was known to a great many others; upon which I was ſent for by the <hi>Houſe;</hi> I declined for four ſeveral times, to ſay what had been propoſed to me; and at laſt, being threatned to be proſecuted by the <hi>Houſe of Commons,</hi> as an <hi>Enemy to the Nation,</hi> I was thus unwillingly brought to own it. But that <hi>Great Man</hi> fell no ſooner under an Eclipſe of Favour, then tho I had felt the weight of his <hi>Credit</hi> for ſeven years together, I made not only all the ſteps neceſſary for a Reconciliation, but I engaged ſome then in <hi>Favour,</hi> ſo far into his Intereſts, that he expreſſed a very thankful acknowledgment of it, and a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Reconciliation with me: Tho upon ſome Reaſons of his own, our Meeting was not thought convenient; and his own <hi>Nephew,</hi> who being now of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion, is a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:101251:96"/> to whom I may the more freely appeal, brought me very kind Meſſages from him, and ſignified them to me after his Death.</p>
            <p>As for all the other things that can be objected to me, I paſs them over, as things which can very little hurt me. The Author it ſeems pities <hi>Varillas</hi>'s defeated Condition, who as my Friends from <hi>Paris</hi> write to me, does not ſo much as pretend to juſtify himſelf of all thoſe groſs Errors of which I have diſcovered him <hi>Guilty;</hi> but ſays, he has received an Order from the King, to inſiſt no more in the Diſpute in which he and I were engaged. Our Author will be a very fit Perſon to ſucceed to that <hi>Deſpicable Writer;</hi> who fancies that I contradict my ſelf, in ſetting forth Q. <hi>Maries Clemency</hi> in one place, and yet ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in another, how <hi>Unmerciful</hi> ſhe ſhewed her ſelf towards thoſe that were condemned of <hi>Hereſy.</hi> The beſt Natures in the World can be corrupted by a falſe Religion; and they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once poſſeſſed with cruel Principles, the more Pious they are, they will be the more true to the Doctrines of their Church, and by conſequence, they will execute all its ſevere Decrees with an unrelenting Rigour. And we have clear Inſtances of this in the Age in which we live, of <hi>Princes</hi> whoſe Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to <hi>Clemency,</hi> are as well known as the Severities to which the Credit of the <hi>Society</hi> has carried them are <hi>Deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is another ſpiteful Inſinuation with which I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude my <hi>Apology:</hi> This Author finding that the <hi>Matters</hi> of <hi>State,</hi> of which he had accuſed me, were not like to Blemiſh me much, reſolved to try what he could do in a Subject of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nature, which was indeed above him; for tho it ſeems he is entertained to Scribble upon the Politicks, yet the matters of Divinity probably do not lie within his Province; but it ſeems he thought that any thing was to be ventured on that might Defame me. He repreſents me as an Enemy to the <hi>Divinity of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> becauſe of the various readings of a verſe in St. <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> that I gave from ſome Ancient <hi>Manuſcripts,</hi> which I ſaw in my <hi>Travels.</hi> And theſe men who have of late ſtudied to make all the World either <hi>Deiſts</hi> or <hi>Socinians,</hi> if they cannot make them <hi>Papiſts,</hi> by repreſenting that, unleſs we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the <hi>Infallibility of the Church,</hi> we cannot upon good grounds
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:101251:96"/> believe either the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> or the <hi>Myſteries of it,</hi> and this with ſo much Heat and Induſtry, as if their deſign were to have us to be any thing rather than <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> yet will accuſe ſome of our Church of thoſe Doctrines, againſt which we have writ with greater force than any of our <hi>Calumniators.</hi> (For we have Accuſers of the other ſide too.) All the <hi>Fathers</hi> that writ againſt the <hi>Arians,</hi> believed thoſe Myſteries, tho they never cited that Paſſage, from which it was reaſonable to conclude, that it was not in their Bibles; otherwiſe it is not to be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that ſuch Men as St. <hi>Athanaſe</hi> and St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> ſhould not have mentioned it; now the many other places of Scripture, that determine me to believe the <hi>Divinity of the Saviour of the World,</hi> are ſo clear, that I believe it equally well, whether this paſſage be acknowledged to be genuine or not. But having for ſome years taken pleaſure to compare <hi>Manuſcripts,</hi> thoſe of the Holy Scriptures were naturally the moſt looked into by me; and ſince a Man that has but a tranſcient View of M. SS. can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtay to examine them in many Paſſages, that Paſſage being the moſt Important of all that are controverted, I turned always to it, and have given the account of what I ſaw ſincerely, both for it and againſt it. For I have learned from <hi>Job, not to lye for God,</hi> ſince truth needs no ſupport from falſhood: And I may well forgive thoſe of a Church, who have built ſo much upon <hi>Forgeries</hi> and <hi>Counterfeit Pieces,</hi> to be angry with me, for giving ſo ſincere an account, as I did of a Matter of Fact. But that <hi>Divine Saviour,</hi> whom <hi>I adore daily, as God equal with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> knows the Injuſtice that is done me in this, as well as in the other falſe Accuſations with which my Enemies ſtudy to blacken me: I can aſſure them, that I have that Deteſtation of all <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and of <hi>theirs</hi> in particular, that I ſhould never <hi>adore him</hi> as I do, if I did not think him to be <hi>by Nature God, over all, bleſſed for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now to conclude, if Men will not receive this Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my ſelf, with the Juſtice that is due to me, I humbly commit my Cauſe to him, <hi>who judges righteouſly; who ſees all things, and who will bring to light the hidden things of diſhoneſty;</hi> and who will either <hi>compaſs me with his favour as with a ſhield,</hi> and cover me from the rage of my Enemies; or if he lets me fall into their hands, will accept of the Sacrifice of
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:101251:97"/> my Life that I offer to him, and <hi>receive me into his Preſence,</hi> where I ſhall be at quiet, and ſafe both from the <hi>Strife of Tongues, and from the Pride of Man.</hi>

               <hi>A Letter,</hi> containing ſome <hi>Remarks</hi> on the <hi>two Papers,</hi> writ by his late Majeſty King <hi>Charles the Second,</hi> concerning <hi>Religion.</hi>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Thank you for the <hi>Two Royal Papers</hi> that you have ſent me: I had heard of them before, but now we have them ſo well atteſted, that there is no hazard of being deceived by a falſe Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py: You expect that in return, I ſhould let you know, what Impreſſion they have made upon me. I pay all the reverence that is due to a <hi>Crown'd Head,</hi> even in Aſhes, to which I will never be wanting: Far leſs am I capable of ſuſpecting the <hi>Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Atteſtation that accompanies them;</hi> of the truth of which I take it for granted no man doubts; but I muſt crave leave to tell you, that I am confident, the <hi>late King</hi> only <hi>Copied them,</hi> and that they are not of <hi>his</hi> compoſing: for as they have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of that <hi>free Air,</hi> with which he expreſſed himſelf; ſo there is a Contexture in them, that does not look like a <hi>Prince;</hi> and the beginning of the <hi>firſt</hi> ſhews it was the effect of a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,</hi> and was to be communicated to another; ſo that I am apt to think they were compoſed by another, and were ſo well reliſhed by the <hi>late King,</hi> that he thought fit to keep them, in oder to his examining them more particularly; and that he was prevailed with <hi>to Copy them,</hi> leſt a Paper of that Nature might have been made a Crime, if it had been found about him written by another hand: And I could name <hi>one</hi> or <hi>two Perſons,</hi> who as they were able enough to compoſe ſuch <hi>Papers,</hi> ſo had Power enough over his Spirit to engage him to Copy them, and to put themſelves out of danger, by reſtoring <hi>the Original.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="189" facs="tcp:101251:97"/>
            <p>You ought to addreſs your ſelf to the <hi>Learned Divines</hi> of our <hi>Church,</hi> for an <hi>Anſwer</hi> to ſuch things in them as puzzle you, and not to one that has not the Honour to be of that <hi>Body;</hi> and that has now carried a Sword for ſome time, and imploys the Leaſure that at any time he enjoys, rather in <hi>Philoſophical</hi> and <hi>Mathematical Enquiries,</hi> than in matters of <hi>Controverſy.</hi> There is indeed one Conſideration, that determined me more eaſily to comply with your deſires, which is, my having had the honour to <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> copiouſly of thoſe matters with the <hi>late King</hi> himſelf; and he having propoſed to me ſome of the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars</hi> that I find in thoſe <hi>Papers;</hi> and I having ſaid ſeveral things to him, in anſwer to thoſe <hi>Heads,</hi> which he offered to me only as <hi>Objections,</hi> with which he ſeemed fully ſatisfied; I am the more willing to communicate to you, <hi>that</hi> which I took the Liberty to lay before his <hi>late Majeſty</hi> on ſeveral occaſions; the Particulars on which he inſiſted in Diſcourſe with me, were the <hi>uſeleſneſs of a Law without a Judg, and the neceſſity of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Tribunal to determine Controverſies;</hi> to which he added, <hi>The many Sects that were in</hi> England, <hi>which ſeemed to be a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary conſequence of the Liberty that every one took to interpret the Scriptures: and he often repeated that of the</hi> Church of England's <hi>arguing, from the obligation to obey the Church, againſt the Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which he thought was of no force, unleſs they allowed more Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to the Church than they ſeemed willing to admit in their Diſputes with the Church of</hi> Rome. But upon this whole Matter I will offer you ſome <hi>Reflections,</hi> that will, I hope, be of as great weight with you, as they are with my ſelf.</p>
            <p n="1">I. All <hi>Arguments</hi> that prove upon ſuch general Conſiderations, That there ought to be an <hi>Infallible Judge</hi> named by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and clothed with his <hi>Authority,</hi> ſignifie nothing, unleſs it can be ſhewed us, in what <hi>Texts of Scripture</hi> that nomination is to be found; and till that is ſhewed, they are only <hi>Arguments</hi> brought to prove that <hi>Chriſt ought to have done ſomewhat that he has not done.</hi> So theſe are in effect ſo many <hi>Arguments</hi> againſt <hi>Chriſt,</hi> unleſs, it appears that he has authoriſed ſuch a <hi>Judge:</hi> therefore the right way to end this diſpute, is, to ſhew where ſuch a <hi>Conſtitution</hi> is authoriſed: So that the moſt that can be made of this is, that it amounts to a <hi>favourable preſumption.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. It is a very unreaſonable thing for us to form <hi>Preſumptions,</hi>
               <pb n="190" facs="tcp:101251:98"/> of what <hi>is,</hi> or <hi>ought to be,</hi> from Inconveniences that do ariſe, in caſe that ſuch things are not: for we may carry this ſo far, that it will not be eaſie to ſtop it. It ſeems more ſuitable to the infinite Goodneſs of <hi>God,</hi> to communicate the knowledge of himſelf to all Mankind, and to furniſh every Man with ſuch aſſiſtances as will certainly prevail over him. It ſeems alſo reaſonable to think, that ſo perfect a Saviour as <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was, ſhould have ſhewed us a <hi>certain Way,</hi> and yet conſiſtent with the <hi>free Uſe of our Faculties,</hi> of avoiding all <hi>ſin:</hi> nor is it very eaſie to imagine, that it ſhould be a reproach on his <hi>Goſpel,</hi> if there is not an <hi>Infallible Preſervative</hi> againſt <hi>Error,</hi> when it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, that there is <hi>no infallible Preſervative againſt Sin:</hi> for it is certain, that the one Damns us more <hi>Infallibly</hi> than the other.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Since <hi>Preſumptions</hi> are ſo much inſiſted on, to prove what things muſt be appointed by <hi>Chriſt;</hi> it is to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that it is alſo a reaſonable <hi>Preſumption,</hi> that if ſuch a <hi>Court</hi> was appointed by him, it muſt be done in ſuch plain terms that there can be no room to queſtion the meaning of them; and ſince this is the hinge upon which all other matters turn, it ought to be expreſſed ſo particularly, in <hi>whom</hi> it is veſted, that there ſhould be no occaſion given to diſpute, whether it is in <hi>One Man</hi> or in <hi>A Body;</hi> and if in a body, whether in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority, or in the two thirds, or in the whole Body unanimouſly agreeing: in ſhort, the Chief thing in all Governments being the Nature and Power of the Judges, thoſe are always di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly ſpecified; and therefore if theſe things are not ſpecifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> it is at leaſt a ſtrong Preſumption <hi>that</hi> Chriſt <hi>did not intend to authoriſe ſuch</hi> Judges.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. There were ſeveral Controverſies raiſed among the <hi>Churches</hi> to which the <hi>Apostles</hi> writ, as appears by the Epiſtles to the <hi>Romans, Corinthians, Galatians</hi> and <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> yet the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> never make uſe of thoſe paſſages that are pretended for this Authority, to put an end to thoſe Controverſies; which is a ſhrewd Preſumption, that they did not underſtand them in that ſenſe in which the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> does now take them. Nor does St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the directions that he gives to <hi>Church-men</hi> in his Epiſtles to <hi>Timotby</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> reckon this of <hi>ſubmitting to the directions of the Church</hi> for one, which he could not have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:101251:98"/> if this be the true meaning of thoſe diſputed paſſages; and yet he has not one word ſounding that way, which is very different from the directions which one poſſeſſed with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent view that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> has of this matter, muſt needs have given.</p>
            <p n="5">V. There are ſome things very expreſly taught in the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> ſuch as the <hi>rules of a Good Life,</hi> the <hi>Uſe of the Sacraments,</hi> the <hi>addreſſing our ſelves to God for Mercy and Grace,</hi> through the Sacrifice that Chriſt offered for us on the Croſs, and the Worſhipping him as <hi>God,</hi> the Death, Reſurrection and Aſcenſion of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the Reſurrection of our Bodies, and Life Everlaſting, by which it is apparent, that we are ſet beyond doubt in thoſe matters; if then there are other paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages more obſcure concerning other matters, we muſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that theſe are not of that Conſequence, otherwiſe they would have been as plainly revealed as the others are; but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all, if the <hi>Authority of the Church</hi> is delivered to us in <hi>diſputable terms,</hi> that is a juſt prejudice againſt it, ſince it is a thing of ſuch Conſequence, that it ought to have been revealed in a way ſo very clear and paſt all diſpute.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. If it is a preſumption for <hi>particular perſons</hi> to judge con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Religion,</hi> which muſt be ſtill referred to the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and other Guides in ſacred matters; this is a good Argument to oblige all <hi>Nations</hi> to continue in the <hi>Eſtabliſhed Religion,</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it may happen to be; and above all others, it was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing Argument in the mouths of the <hi>Jews</hi> againſt our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.</hi> He pretended to be the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and proved it both by the <hi>propheſies</hi> that were accompliſhed in him, and by the <hi>Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> that he wrought: as for the <hi>Propheſies,</hi> the Reaſons urged by the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> will conclude much ſtronger, that ſuch dark Paſſages as thoſe of the Prophets were, ought not to be interpreted by <hi>Particular perſons,</hi> but that the Expoſition of theſe muſt be referred to the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> it being expreſly provided in their law (<hi>Deut.</hi> 17.8.) <hi>That when contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies aroſe, concerning any cauſe that was too intricate, they were to go to the place which God ſhould chooſe, and to the Prieſts of the tribe of Levi, and to the judge in thoſe days, and that they were to declare what was right, and to their deciſion all were obliged to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, under pain of death:</hi> ſo that by this it appears, that the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:101251:99"/> 
               <hi>Prieſts</hi> in the <hi>Jewiſh Religion</hi> were authorized in ſo extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry a manner, that I dare ſay the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> would not wiſh for a more formal Teſtimony on her behalf: As for our <hi>Saviour's Miracles,</hi> theſe were not ſufficient neither, unleſs his <hi>doctrine</hi> was firſt found to be good: ſince <hi>Moſes</hi> had expreſly warned the People (<hi>Deut.</hi> 13:1.) <hi>That if a Prophet came and taught them to follow after other Gods, they were not to obey him, tho he wrought miracles to prove his Miſſion, but were to put him to death:</hi> So a <hi>Jew</hi> ſaying, that <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by making himſelf one with his father, brought in the worſhip of another <hi>God,</hi> might well pretend that he was not obliged to yield to the authority of our <hi>Saviour's Miracles,</hi> without taking cognizance of his doctrine, and of the Propheſies concerning the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and in a word, of the whole matter. So that, if theſe <hi>Reaſonings</hi> are now good againſt the <hi>Reformation,</hi> they were as ſtrong in the mouths of the <hi>Jews</hi> againſt our <hi>Saviour;</hi> and from hence we ſee, that the authority that ſeems to be given by <hi>Moſes</hi> to the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> muſt be underſtood with ſome Reſtrictions; ſince we not only find the Prophets, and <hi>Jeremy</hi> in particular, oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing themſelves to the whole body of them, but we ſee like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, that for ſome conſiderable time before our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s days, not only many ill grounded <hi>traditions</hi> had got in among them, by which the vigour of the moral law was much enervated; but likewiſe they were alſo univerſally poſſeſſed with a falſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their <hi>Meſſias;</hi> ſo that even the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> themſelves had not quite ſhaken off thoſe Prejudices at the time of our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s <hi>Aſcenſion.</hi> So that here a Church, that was ſtill the <hi>Church of God,</hi> that had the appointed means of the <hi>Expiation of their ſins,</hi> by their <hi>Sacrifices</hi> and <hi>Waſhings,</hi> as well as by their <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> was yet under great and fatal <hi>Errors,</hi> from which particular perſons had no way to extricate themſelves, but by examining the Doctrine and texts of <hi>Scripture,</hi> and by judging of them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Evidence of Truth, and the force and freedom of their Faculties.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. It ſeems Evident, that the paſſage <hi>[Tell the Church]</hi> belongs only to the <hi>Reconciling of Differences,</hi> that of <hi>[Bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and of Looſing]</hi> according to the uſe of thoſe terms among the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſignifies only an <hi>Authority</hi> that was given to the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,</hi> of giving Precepts, by which men were to be obliged to
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:101251:99"/> ſuch Duties, or ſet at liberty from them: and [<hi>the gates of Hell not prevailing againſt the Church</hi> J ſignifies only, that the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion</hi> was never to come to an end, or to periſh: and that of <hi>[Chriſts being with the Apoſtles to the end of the world]</hi> imports only a ſpecial <hi>Conduct</hi> and <hi>Protection</hi> which the <hi>Church</hi> may always expect; but as the promiſe, <hi>I will not leave thee nor forſake thee;</hi> that belongs to every <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> does not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port an <hi>infallibility:</hi> no more does the other: And for thoſe paſſages concerning <hi>[the ſpirit of God that ſearches all things]</hi> it is plain, that in them St. <hi>Paul</hi> is treating of the <hi>Divine inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> by which the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> was then opened to the world; which he ſets in oppoſition to the <hi>wiſdom</hi> or <hi>Philoſophy</hi> of the <hi>Greeks;</hi> ſo that as all thoſe paſſages come far ſhort of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that for which they are alledged; it muſt at leaſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, that they have not an evidence great enough to prove ſo important a truth, as ſome would evince by them; ſince 'tis a matter of ſuch vaſt conſequence, that the proofs for it muſt have an undeniable Evidence.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. In the matters of <hi>Religion,</hi> two things are to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered; firſt, The <hi>Account</hi> that we muſt give to God, and the <hi>Rewards</hi> that we expect from him: And in this every Man muſt anſwer for the ſincerity of his Heart, in examining Divine Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; and the following, what (upon the beſt enquiries that one could make) appeared to be true; and with Relation to this, there is no need of a <hi>Judg;</hi> for in that Great Day every one muſt anſwer to God according to the Talents that he had, and all will be ſaved according to their Sincerity; and with Relation to that Judgment, there is no need of any other Judg but God. A ſecond View of <hi>Religion,</hi> is, as it is a <hi>Body</hi> united together, and by conſequence brought under ſome Regulation. And as in all <hi>States,</hi> there are ſubaltern <hi>Judges,</hi> in whoſe Deciſions all muſt at leaſt acquieſce, tho they are not <hi>Infallible,</hi> there being ſtill a ſort of an Appeal to be made to the <hi>Soveraign,</hi> or the Supream Legiſlative Body; ſo the <hi>Church</hi> has a Subaltern <hi>Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction;</hi> but as the Authority of inferior Judges is ſtill regulated, and none but the Legiſlators themſelves have an Authority equal to the Law: So it is not neceſſary for the Preſervation of Peace and Order, that the <hi>Deciſions</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> ſhould be <hi>Infallible,</hi> or of equal <hi>Authority</hi> with the <hi>Scriptures.</hi> If Judges
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:101251:100"/> do ſo manifeſtly abuſe their Authority, that they fall into Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion and Treaſon, the Subjects are no more bound to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them, but are obliged to reſiſt them, and to maintain their Obedience to their Soveraign; tho in other matters their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment muſt take place, till they are reverſed by the Soveraign. The caſe of <hi>Religion</hi> being then this, <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt is the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign of the Church;</hi> the Aſſembly of the <hi>Paſtors</hi> is only a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altern <hi>Judg:</hi> If they manifeſtly oppoſe themſelves to the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> which is the <hi>Law of Chriſtians,</hi> particular Perſons may be ſuppoſed as competent <hi>Judges</hi> of that, as in Civil Matters they may be of the <hi>Rebellion</hi> of the <hi>Judges;</hi> and in that caſe they are bound ſtill to maintain their Obedience to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> in matters <hi>Indifferent.</hi> Chriſtians are bound for the Preſervation of Peace and Unity, to acquieſce in the Deciſion of the <hi>Church,</hi> and in matters juſtly doubtful, or of ſmall Conſequence, tho they are convinced that the <hi>Paſtors</hi> have erred, yet they are obliged to be Silent, and to bear tolerable things, rather than make a Breach: but if it is viſible, that the <hi>Paſtors</hi> do <hi>Rebel</hi> againſt the <hi>Soveraign</hi> of the Church, I mean <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the People may put in their Appeal to that great <hi>Judg,</hi> and there it muſt lie. If the <hi>Church</hi> did uſe this Authority with due Diſcretion, and the People followed the Rules that I have named with Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and Modeſty, there would be no great danger of many Diviſions; but this is the great Secret of the Providence of God, that men are ſtill men, and both <hi>Paſtors</hi> and <hi>People</hi> mix their Paſſions and Intereſts ſo with matters of <hi>Religion,</hi> that there is a great deal of Sin and Vice ſtill in the World, ſo that it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in the Matters of <hi>Religion,</hi> as well as in other things: but the ill Conſequences of this, tho they are bad enough, yet are not equal to the Effects that ignorant Superſtition, and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Zeal have produced in the World, witneſs the Rebellions and <hi>Wars</hi> for eſtabliſhing the <hi>Worſhip of Images,</hi> the <hi>Croiſſades</hi> againſt the <hi>Saracens,</hi> in which many Millions were loſt; thoſe againſt <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks,</hi> and <hi>Princes</hi> depoſed by <hi>Popes,</hi> which laſted for ſome Ages; and the <hi>Maſſacre</hi> of <hi>Paris,</hi> with the Butcheries of the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> in the laſt Age, and that of <hi>Ireland</hi> in this; which are, I ſuppoſe, far greater Miſchiefs than any that can be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined to ariſe out of a <hi>ſmall diverſity of Opinion;</hi> and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent State of this <hi>Church,</hi> notwithſtanding all thoſe unhappy
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:101251:100"/> 
               <hi>Rents</hi> that are in it, is a much more deſirable thing, than the <hi>groſs Ignorance</hi> and <hi>blind Superſtition</hi> that reigns in <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> at this day.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. All theſe reaſonings concerning the <hi>Infallibility of the Church,</hi> ſignify nothing, unleſs we can certainly know, <hi>whither we muſt go for this Deciſion;</hi> for while one Party ſhews us, that it muſt be in the <hi>Pope,</hi> or is no where; and another Party ſays it cannot be in the <hi>Pope,</hi> becauſe as many <hi>Popes</hi> have erred, ſo this is a <hi>Doctrine</hi> that was not known in the <hi>Church</hi> for a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years, and that has been diſputed ever ſince it was firſt aſſerted, we are in the right to believe both ſides; <hi>firſt,</hi> that if it is not in the <hi>Pope,</hi> it is no where; and then, that certainly it it not in the <hi>Pope;</hi> and it is very Incongruous to ſay, That there is an <hi>Infallible</hi> Authority in the <hi>Church,</hi> and that yet it is not certain where one muſt ſeek for it; for the one ought to be as clear as the other; and it is alſo plain, that what <hi>Primacy</hi> ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever St. <hi>Peter</hi> may be ſuppoſed to have had, the Scripture ſays not one word of his <hi>Succeſſors</hi> at <hi>Rome;</hi> ſo at leaſt this is not ſo clear, as a matter of this Conſequence muſt have been, if <hi>Chriſt</hi> had intended to have lodged ſuch an <hi>Authority</hi> in that <hi>See.</hi>
            </p>

If it is ſaid, <hi>That this</hi> Infallibility <hi>is to be ſought for in the</hi> Tradition <hi>of the</hi> Doctrine <hi>in all Ages, and that every</hi> particular Perſon <hi>muſt examine this:</hi> Here is a Sea before him, and inſtead of examining the ſmall Book of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> he is invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in a Study that muſt coſt a Man an Age to go thorow it; and many of the <hi>Ages,</hi> through which he carries this Enquiry, are ſo dark, and have produced ſo few Writers, at leaſt ſo few are preſerved to our days, that it is not poſſible to find out their belief. We find alſo <hi>Traditions</hi> have varied ſo much, that it is hard to ſay, that there is much weight to be laid on this way of Conveyance. A <hi>Tradition</hi> concerning Matters of Fact that all People ſee, is leſs apt to fail than a <hi>Tradition</hi> of Points of Speculation; and yet we ſee very near the Age of the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,</hi> contrary <hi>Traditions</hi> touching the <hi>Obſervation of Eaſter,</hi> from which we muſt conclude, that either the Matter of Fact of one ſide, or the other, as it was handed down, was not true, or at leaſt, that it was not rightly underſtood. A <hi>Tradition</hi> concerning the <hi>Uſe of the Sacraments,</hi> being a viſible thing, is more likely to be exact, than a Speculation concerning their Nature; and yet we find a <hi>Tradition</hi> of giving <hi>Infants</hi> the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,</hi> grounded on the indiſpenſible neceſſity of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, continued a thouſand years in the <hi>Church.</hi> A <hi>Tradition</hi> on which the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> founded their <hi>Joy</hi> and <hi>Hope,</hi> is leſs like to be changed, than a more remote Speculation; and yet the firſt Writers of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> had a <hi>Tradition</hi> handed down to them by thoſe who ſaw the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> of the <hi>Reign of Chriſt for a thouſand year upon Earth;</hi> and if thoſe who had Matters at the ſecond hand from the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> could be thus miſtaken, it is more reaſonable to apprehend greater Errors at ſuch a diſtance. A <hi>Tradition</hi> concerning the <hi>Book</hi> of the
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:101251:101"/> 
               <hi>Scriptures</hi> is more like to be exact, than the Expoſition of ſome Paſſages in it; and yet we find the <hi>Church</hi> did unanimouſly believe the <hi>Tranſlation</hi> of the 70. <hi>Interpreters</hi> to have been the effect of a miraculous Inſpiration, till St. <hi>Jerome</hi> examined this Matter better, and made a <hi>New Tranſlation</hi> from the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Copies. But which is more than all the reſt, it ſeems plain, That the <hi>Fathers</hi> before the <hi>Council of Nice,</hi> believed the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity</hi> of the <hi>Son of God</hi> to be in ſome ſort <hi>Inferior</hi> to that of the <hi>Father,</hi> and for ſome Ages after the <hi>Council of Nice,</hi> they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved them indeed both equal; but they conſider theſe as two different Beings, and only one in <hi>Eſſence,</hi> as three. Men have the ſame humane Nature in common among them; and that as one Candle lights another, ſo the one flowed from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and after the <hi>fifth Century,</hi> the Doctrine of <hi>one individual Eſſence</hi> was received. If you will be farther informed concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, <hi>Father Petua</hi> will ſatisfy you as to the firſt Period be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Council of Nice,</hi> and the Learned Dr. <hi>Cudworth,</hi> as to the ſecond. In all which particulars it appears, how variable a thing <hi>Tradition</hi> is. And upon the whole Matter, the examining <hi>Tradition</hi> thus, is ſtill a ſearching among Books, and here is no living Judg.</p>
            <p n="12">XII. If then the <hi>Authority</hi> that muſt decide <hi>Controverſies,</hi> lies in the Body of the <hi>Paſtors</hi> ſcattered over the World, which is the laſt Retrenchment; here as many and as great Scruples will ariſe, as we found in any of the former Heads. Two difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties appear at firſt View, the one is, <hi>How can we be aſſured that the preſent</hi> Paſtors <hi>of the</hi> Church <hi>are derived in a juſt Succeſſion from the</hi> Apoſtles; there are no <hi>Regiſters</hi> extant that prove this: So that we have nothing for it but ſome <hi>Hiſtories,</hi> that are ſo careleſly writ, that we find many miſtakes in them in other Matters; and they are ſo different in the very firſt links of that Chain, that immediately ſucceded the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> that the utmoſt can be made of this, is, that here is a Hiſtorical <hi>Relation</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what doubtful; but here is nothing to found our Faith on: So that if a Succeſſion from the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> times, is neceſſary to the Conſtitution of that <hi>Church,</hi> to which we muſt ſubmit our ſelves, we know not where to find it; beſides, that the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the neceſſity of the <hi>Intention</hi> of the <hi>Miniſter</hi> to the <hi>Validity</hi> of a <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,</hi> throws us into inextricable difficulties. I know they
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:101251:102"/> generally ſay, That by the <hi>Intention</hi> they do not mean the <hi>inward</hi> Acts of the Miniſter of the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> but only that it muſt appear by his <hi>outward</hi> Deportment, that he is in earneſt going about a <hi>Sacrament,</hi> and not doing a thing in jeſt; and this appeared ſo reaſonable to me, that I was ſorry to find our <hi>Divines</hi> urge it too much; till turning over the <hi>Rubricks</hi> that are at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the <hi>Miſſal,</hi> I found upon the head of the <hi>Intention</hi> of the Miniſter, that if a <hi>Prieſt</hi> has a number of <hi>Hoſties</hi> before him to be conſecrated, and intends to Conſecrate them all, except one, in that caſe that vagrant Exception falls upon them all; it not being affixed to any one, and it is defined that he Conſecrates none at all. Here it is plain, that the ſecret <hi>Acts</hi> of a <hi>Prieſt</hi> can defeat the <hi>Sacrament;</hi> ſo that this overthrows all certainty concerning a <hi>Succeſſion:</hi> But beſides all this, we are ſure, that the <hi>Greek Churches</hi> have a much more unconteſted <hi>Succeſſion</hi> than the <hi>Latins;</hi> ſo that a <hi>Succeſſion</hi> cannot direct us. And if it is neceſſary to ſeek out the Doctrines that are univerſally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, this is not poſſible for a private Man to know. So that in ignorant Countries, where there is little Study, the People have no other certainty concerning their <hi>Religion,</hi> but what they take from their <hi>Curate</hi> and <hi>Confeſſor;</hi> ſince they cannot examine what is generally received. So that it muſt be confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that all the Arguments that are brought for the neceſſity of a conſtant <hi>Infallible Judg,</hi> turn againſt all thoſe of the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> that do not acknowledg the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of the <hi>Pope;</hi> for if he is not <hi>Infallible,</hi> they have no other <hi>Judg</hi> that can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to it. It were alſo eaſy to ſhew, That ſome <hi>Doctrines</hi> have been as univerſally received in ſome <hi>Ages,</hi> as they have been rejected in others; which ſhews, that the Doctrine of the preſent <hi>Church</hi> is not always a ſure meaſure. For five <hi>Ages</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, the Doctrine of the <hi>Popes</hi> Power to <hi>depoſe Heretical Princes,</hi> was received without the leaſt Oppoſition; and this cannot be doubted by any that knows what has been the State of the <hi>Church,</hi> ſince the end of the Eleventh <hi>Century;</hi> and yet I believe few <hi>Princes</hi> would allow this, notwithſtanding all the concurring Authority of ſo many Ages to fortify it. I could carry this into a great many other Inſtances, but I ſingle out this, becauſe it is a Point in which <hi>Princes</hi> are naturally extream ſenſible.</p>
            <pb n="199" facs="tcp:101251:102"/>
            <p>Upon the whole Matter, it can never enter into my mind, that God, who has made Man a Creature, that naturally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires and reaſons, and that feels as ſenſible a pleaſure, when he can give himſelf a good account of his Actions, as one that ſees, does perceive in Compariſon to a blind Man that is led about; and that this God, that has alſo made <hi>Religion</hi> on deſign to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect this humane Nature, and to raiſe it to the utmoſt height to which it can arrive, has contrived it to be dark, and to be ſo much beyond the Penetration of our Faculties, that we cannot find out his mind in thoſe things that are neceſſary for our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; and that the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> that were writ by plain Men, in a very familiar Stile, and addreſt without any Diſcriminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Vulgar, ſhould become ſuch an unintelligible Book in theſe Ages, that we muſt have an <hi>Infallible Judg</hi> to expound it; and when I ſee not only <hi>Popes,</hi> but even ſome Bodies that paſs for <hi>General Councils,</hi> have ſo expounded many Paſſages of it, and have wreſted them ſo viſibly, that none of the <hi>Modern Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> of that <hi>Church</hi> pretend to excuſe it: I ſay, I muſt freely own to you, that when I find I need a <hi>Commentary</hi> on dark Paſſages, theſe will be the laſt Perſons to whom I will addreſs my ſelf for it. Thus you ſee how fully I have opened my mind to you in this matter: I have gone over a great deal of Ground in as few Words as is poſſible, becauſe hints I know are enough for you. I thank God, theſe Conſiderations do fully ſatisfy me, and I will be infinitely joyed, if they have the ſame effect on you.</p>

            <p>WHen the <hi>Cardinals</hi> in <hi>Rome</hi> go abroad without <hi>Fiocco</hi>'s on their Horſes heads, it is underſtood that they will be then <hi>Incognito,</hi> and they expect nothing of that Reſpect which is payed them on other Occaſions. So ſince there is no <hi>Fiocco</hi> at the Head of this <hi>Diſcourſe,</hi> no Name nor Deſignation, it ſeems the Writer offers himſelf to be examined without thoſe nice regards, that may be due to the Dignity he bears; and indeed, when a Man forgets what he is himſelf, it is very natural for others to do it likewiſe.</p>
            <p>It is no wonder to ſee thoſe of the <hi>Roman Communion</hi> beſtir themſelves, ſo much as they do, to be delivered from the <hi>Teſt,</hi> and every thing elſe that is uneaſy to them; and tho others may find it very reaſonable to oppoſe themſelves in all the juſt and legal ways that agree with our Conſtitution, to this Deſign; yet it is ſo natural to all that are under any Preſſure, to deſire to get free from it, that at the ſame time that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not forbear to withſtand them, we cannot much condemn them; but it raiſes nature a little, to ſee a <hi>Man</hi> that has been ſo long fatned with the <hi>Spoils</hi> of our Church, and who has
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:101251:103"/> now got up to a degree ſo diſproportioned to his Merit, to turn ſo treacherouſly upon it. If he is already weary of his <hi>comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table importance,</hi> and will here give her into the Bargain, and declare himſelf; no Body will be ſurprized at the change of his Maſque: ſince he has taken much pains to convince the World, that his <hi>Religion</hi> goes no deeper than his <hi>Habit:</hi> yet, tho his Confidence is of a piece with all his other Virtues, few thought it could have carried him ſo far: I confeſs I am not ſurprized, but rather wonder to ſee that others ſhould be ſo: for he has given ſufficient warning of what he is capable of; he has told the World <hi>what is the worst thing that Dr.</hi> Burnet <hi>can do,</hi> p. 50. But I am ſure the Dr. cannot be quit with him, to tell what is the <hi>worſt thing</hi> that he can do; it muſt needs be a very fruitful ſancy that can find out all the degrees of wickedneſs to which he can go: and tho this Pamphlet is a good Eſſay of his Talent that way, yet that <hi>Terra Incognita</hi> is boundleſs. In the <hi>title Page</hi> it is ſaid that this was <hi>firſt writ for the Author's own ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and now publiſhed for the benefit of all others whom it may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern.</hi> But the words are certainly wrong placed; for the truth of the matter is, That it was <hi>Written for the Author's own bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, and that it is now publiſhed for the ſatisfaction of all others whom it may concern:</hi> in ſome ſenſe perhaps it was written for the Author's own ſatisfaction: for ſo petulant and ſo depraved a mind as His, is capable of being delighted with His Treachery: and a poor <hi>Biſhoprick</hi> with the addition of a <hi>Preſidentſhip</hi> being too low a prize for His Ambition and Avarice, He reſolved to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure Himſelf of the firſt great <hi>Biſhoprick</hi> that falls; the <hi>Liege Letter</hi> lets us ſee how far the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> were aſſured of Him, and how much courted by Him: and that He ſaid, <hi>That none but</hi> Atheiſts <hi>ſupported the Proteſtant Religion now in</hi> England; yet how many ſoever of theſe may be among us, He is upon the point of leſſening their number, by one at leaſt: and he takes care to juſtifie the hopes which theſe <hi>Fathers</hi> conceived of Him. They are ſevere Maſters, and will not be put off with ſecret Civilities, lewd Jeſts, Entertainments, and Healths drank to their good Succeſs; ſo now the Price of the <hi>Preſidentſhip</hi> is to be pay'd, ſo good a Morſel as this deſerved that Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> Dr. <hi>Tillotſon,</hi> Dr. <hi>Burnet,</hi> and ſome other Divines ſhould be ill uſed, and He to preſerve the Character of <hi>Drawcanſir,</hi> which is
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:101251:104"/> as due to Him as that of <hi>Bays,</hi> falls upon the <hi>Articles</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> and upon both <hi>Houſes</hi> of <hi>Parliament.</hi> It is Reproach enough to the <hi>Houſe of Lords,</hi> that He is of it; but it is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what new, and a Character becoming <hi>Sa. Oxon,</hi> to arraign that <hi>Houſe</hi> with all the Inſolence to which he can raiſe his wanton Pen. Laws that are in being are treated with reſpect even by thoſe who move for their Repeal; but our <hi>Drawcanſir</hi> ſcorns that modeſt ſtrain, he is not contented to arraign the <hi>Law,</hi> but calls it <hi>Barbarous,</hi> and ſays, <hi>That nothing can be more Barbarous and Prophane than to make the renouncing of a Myſtery, ſo unanimouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received, a</hi> State Teſt; <hi>pag.</hi> 133. <hi>pag.</hi> 64. But he ought to have avoided the word <hi>Prophane,</hi> ſince it leads men to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that he had taxed the Praying for the King, <hi>as under God and Chriſt, as Crude,</hi> not to ſay <hi>Prophane:</hi> when in the Proſpect he had then [36] of a <hi>Biſhoprick,</hi> he raiſed the <hi>King</hi> above <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but now another Proſpect, will make him ſink him beneath the <hi>Pope,</hi> who is but at beſt <hi>Chriſt's Vicar.</hi> But this is not all, there comes another Flower that is worthy of him; he tells us, <hi>That the TEST was the firſt-born of</hi> Oats's <hi>Plot, and brought forth on purpoſe to give Credit and Reputation to the Perjury,</hi> p. 5. And becauſe this went in common between the <hi>Two Houſes,</hi> he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows a more particular mark of his Favour on the <hi>Houſe of Lords:</hi> and tells them, <hi>That this was a Monument erected by themſelves in honour of ſo groſs an Impoſture.</hi> (Ibid.) But after all, the Royal <hi>Aſſent</hi> was added; and here no doubt it itched ſomewhere, for if it had not been for the manner of the Late King's Death, and the <hi>Papers</hi> publiſhed ſince his <hi>Death,</hi> he would have wreaked his Malice upon his <hi>Memory,</hi> for he will never forgive his not advancing him: And the Late <hi>King</hi> being ſo true a Judg of Wit, could not but be much taken with the beſt <hi>Satyr</hi> of our Time; and ſaw that <hi>Bays</hi>'s <hi>Wit,</hi> when meaſured with another's, was of a piece with his Virtues, and therefore judged in favour of the <hi>Rehearſal Tranſpros'd:</hi> this went deep, and though it gave occaſion to the ſingle piece of Modeſty, with which he can be charged, of withdrawing from the Town, and not importuning the Preſs more for ſome years, ſince even a Face of Braſs muſt grow red, when it is ſo burnt as his was then; yet his Malice againſt the Elder <hi>Brother</hi> was never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed but with his Life: But now a ſtrange Conjuncture has
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:101251:104"/> brought him again on the Stage, and <hi>Bays</hi> will be <hi>Bays</hi> ſtill.</p>
            <p>He begins his Prologue with the only ſoft word in the whole piece, <hi>I humbly Conceive;</hi> but he quickly repents him of that <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonarity,</hi> and ſo makes <hi>Thunder</hi> and <hi>Lightning</hi> ſpeak the reſt, as if his Deſigns were to Inſult over the two Houſes, and not to convince them. He who is one of the Punies of his Order, and is certainly one of its juſteſt Reproaches, tells us pag. 8. <q rend="inline">That to the Shame of the Biſhops, this Law was conſented to by them in the Houſe of Lords:</q> But what ſhame is due to him, who has treated that Venerable <hi>Bench,</hi> and in particular his <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitan,</hi> in ſo ſcurrilous a manner? The <hi>Order</hi> has much more cauſe to be aſhamed of ſuch a Member: tho if there are two or three ſuch as he is among the twenty ſix, they may Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort themſelves with this, that a dozen of <hi>much better</hi> Men, had one ameng them, that I confeſs was not <hi>much worſe,</hi> if it was not for this, that <hi>he</hi> let the Price of his Treachery fall much lower than <hi>Sa. Oxon</hi> does, who is ſtill true to his old Maxim, that he delivered in Anſwer to one who asked him, <q rend="inline">What was the beſt Body of Divinity? Which was, That that which could help a man to keep a Coach and ſix Horſes, was certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the beſt.</q> But now I come to Examine his Reaſons for A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brogating the TEST.</p>
            <p>The firſt is, <q rend="inline">That it is contrary to the <hi>Natural Rights of Peerage,</hi> and turns the Birth-Right of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nobility into a Precarious Title, which is at the mercy of every Faction and Paſſion in Parliament; and that therefore, how uſeful ſoever the TEST might have been in its Seaſon, it ſome time muſt prove a very ill Preſident againſt the Right of Peerage: and upon this he tells a Story of a Proteſtation made in the Houſe of Lords, againſt the TEST, that was brought in in 1675, together with the Reſolution of the Houſe againſt that Penalty upon the Peers, of loſing their Votes in caſe of a Refuſal: he repreſents this, as a Teſt or Oath of Loyalty againſt the Lawfulneſs of taking Arms up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any pretence whatſoever againſt the King.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But in Anſwer to all this, one would gladly know what are the <hi>Natural Rights</hi> of <hi>Peerage,</hi> and in what Chapter of the Law of Nature they are to be found; for if thoſe Rights have no other Warrant, but the Conſtitution of this Government, then
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:101251:105"/> they are ſtill ſubject to the Legiſlative Authority, and may be regulated by it. The Right of Peerage is ſtill in the Family, only as the exerciſe of it is limited by the Law to ſuch an Age, ſo it may be Suſpended as oft as the Publick Safety comes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it: even the indelible Character it ſelf, may be brought under a total Suſpenſion, of which our Author may, perhaps, afford an inſtance at ſome time or other.</p>
            <p n="2">2.. Votes in either Houſe of Parliament, are never to be put in ballance with Eſtabliſh'd Laws: Theſe are but the Opinions of One Houſe, and are changeable.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But if the TEST might have been uſeful in its Seaſon, one would gladly ſee how it ſhould be ſo ſoon out of Seaſon: for its chief uſe being to Secure the Proteſtant Religion in 1678, it does not appear, That now in 1688, the Dangers are ſo quite diſſipated, that there is no more need of ſecuring it. In one Senſe we are in a ſafer Condition than we were then: For ſome falſe Brethren have ſhewed themſelves, and have loſt that little Credit which ſome unhappy Accidents had procured them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It was not the Loyalty in the TEST of the Year 1675, that raiſed the greateſt oppoſition to it: But another part of it, <q rend="inline">That they ſhould never Endeavour any alteration in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, either in the Church or State.</q> Now it ſeemed to be an unreaſonable Limitation on the Legiſlative Body, to have the <hi>Members</hi> engaged to make no Alteration: And it is that which would not have much pleaſed thoſe, <hi>For whoſe ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction this Book is publiſhed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond Reaſon was already hinted at, <hi>of its diſhonourable birth and original;</hi> p. 10. which according to the decency of his Stile, he calls <hi>the firſt Sacrament of the Oteſian Villany,</hi> pag. 9. This he aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vates <hi>as ſuch a Monſtrous and Inhuman piece of Barbarity as could never have entered into the thoughts of any man but the infamous Author of it;</hi> this piece of Elegance, tho it belongs to this Reaſon, comes in again in his fourth Reaſon, <hi>pag.</hi> 6. and to let the <hi>Houſe of Lords</hi> ſee their Fate, if they will not yield to his <hi>Reaſons,</hi> he tells them that this will be not only an <q rend="inline">Eternal National Reproach, but ſuch a blot upon the <hi>Peers,</hi> that no length of time could wear away, nothing but the Univerſal Conflagration could deſtroy;</q> Which are the apteſt Expreſſions
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:101251:105"/> that I know to mark how deeply the many blots with which he is ſtigmatized are rooted in his Nature. The wanton man in his <hi>Drawcanſir</hi>-humor thinks that <hi>Parliaments</hi> and a <hi>Houſe of Peers</hi> are to be treated by him with as much ſcorn as is juſtly due to himſelf. But to ſet this matter in its true Light, it is to be remembred that in 1678, there were beſides the Evidences of the <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> a great many other Diſcoveries made of <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> and <hi>Negotiations</hi> in forreign Parts, chiefly in the Courts of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> for Extirpating the <hi>Proteſtant Religion;</hi> upon which the <hi>Party</hi> that was moſt united to the <hi>Court,</hi> ſet on this Law, for the <hi>Teſt,</hi> as that which was both in it ſelf a juſt and neceſſary Security for the Eſtabliſh'd <hi>Religion,</hi> and that would probably lay the fermentation which was then in the Nation: and the <hi>Act</hi> was ſo little acceptable to him, whom he calls <hi>its Author,</hi> that he ſpake of it then with Contempt, as a <hi>Trick</hi> of the Court to lay the <hi>Nation</hi> too ſoon aſleep. The Negotiations beyond Sea were too evidently proved to be denied; and (which is not yet generally known) Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> when Examined by the <hi>Committee</hi> of the Houſe of <hi>Commons,</hi> ſaid plain enough to them, that the Late <hi>King</hi> was concerned in them; but the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee</hi> would not look into that matter, and ſo Mr. <hi>Sacheverill,</hi> that was their Chair-man, did not report it; yet the thing was not ſo ſecret but that one to whom it was truſted, gave the late King an Account of it; who ſaid, That he had not heard of it any other way, and was ſo fully convinced that the Nation had cauſe given them to be jealous, that he himſelf ſet forward the <hi>Act,</hi> and the rather becauſe he ſaw that the <hi>E.</hi> of <hi>S.</hi> did not much like it. The <hi>Parliament</hi> as long as it was known that the <hi>Religion</hi> was ſafe in the <hi>King</hi>'s Negative, had not taken any great care of its own Conſtitution, but it ſeemed the beſt Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient that could be found, for laying the Jealouſies of His late <hi>Majeſty,</hi> and the apprehenſions of the <hi>Succeſſor,</hi> to take ſo much care of the <hi>two Houſes,</hi> that ſo the Dangers with which men were then allarm'd, might ſeem the leſs formidable, upon ſo effectual a ſecurity: and thus all the ſtir that he keeps with <hi>Perjury</hi> and <hi>Impoſture,</hi> ought to make no other impreſſion, but to ſhew the wantonneſs of his own Temper, that meddles ſo boldly with things of which he knew ſo little the true Secret: For here was a Law paſſed of which all made great uſe that
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:101251:106"/> oppoſed <hi>the Bill of Excluſion,</hi> to Demonſtrate to the Nation that there could be no danger of <hi>Popery,</hi> even under a <hi>Prince</hi> of that <hi>Religion;</hi> but as he would turn the matter, it amounts to this, That that Law might be of good uſe in that ſeaſon to lay the Jealouſies of the Nation, till there were a <hi>Prince</hi> on the Throne of that <hi>Communion,</hi> and then when the turn is ſerved, it muſt be thrown away, to open the only door that is now ſhut upon the Re-eſtabliſhment of that <hi>Religion.</hi> This is but one hint among a great many more of the ſtate of Affairs at the time that this <hi>Act</hi> of the TEST was made, to ſhew that the <hi>Evidence</hi> given by the <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> had no other ſhare in that matter, but that it gave a riſe to the other Diſcoveries; and a fair Opportunity to thoſe who knew the ſecret of the late <hi>King</hi>'s Religion, and the Negotiation at <hi>Dover,</hi> to provide ſuch an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual Security, as might both ſave the <hi>Crown,</hi> and ſecure the <hi>Religion:</hi> and this I am ſure ſome of the <hi>Biſhops</hi> knew, who <hi>(to their Honour)</hi> were faithful to both.</p>
            <p>The third Reaſon he gives for Repealing the <hi>Act,</hi> is <hi>the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>competent Authority of thoſe who Enacted it; for it was of an Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical nature:</hi> and here he ſtretches out his Wings to a Top-flight, and charges it with nothing leſs than <hi>the Depoſing of Chriſt from his Throne, the diſowning, neglecting and affronting his Commiſſion to his Catholick Church, and entrenching upon this ſacred Prerogative of his Holy Catholick Church:</hi> and then that he might have occaſion to feed his ſpleen with railing at the whole <hi>Order,</hi> he makes a ridiculous objection of the <hi>Biſhops</hi> being preſent in the <hi>Houſe of Lords,</hi> that he might ſhew his reſpect to them, by telling in a Parentheſis <hi>that (to their ſhame) they had conſented to it.</hi> But has this <hi>Scaramuchio</hi> no ſhame left him? Did the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> pretend by this <hi>Act</hi> to make any Deciſion in thoſe two Points of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> and <hi>Idolatry?</hi> Had not the Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation defined them both for above an Age before? In the 28th <hi>Article</hi> of our <hi>Church</hi> theſe words are to be found: <hi>Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation (or the change of the ſubſtance of Bread and Wine) in the Supper of the Lord, cannot be proved by Holy Writ: but it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the plain words of Scripture, overthrows the nature of a Sacrament, and hath given occaſion to many ſuperſtitions;</hi> and for the <hi>Idolatry</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> that was alſo declared very expreſly in the ſame body of <hi>Articles:</hi> ſince in the Article 35,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:101251:106"/> the <hi>Homilies</hi> are declared <q rend="inline">to contain a godly and wholeſom Doctrine neceſſary for thoſe times: and upon that it is judged that they ſhould be read in the Churches, by the Miniſters, diligently and diſtinctly, that they may be underſtood of the People.</q> And the Second of theſe, which is againſt the <hi>Peril of Idolatry,</hi> aggravates the <hi>Idolatry</hi> of that <hi>Church</hi> in ſo many particulars, and with ſuch ſevere Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, that thoſe who at firſt made thoſe <hi>Articles,</hi> and all thoſe who do now ſign them, or oblige others to ſign 'em, muſt either believe the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> to be guilty of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> or that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> is the Impudenteſt Society that ever aſſumed the Name of a <hi>Church,</hi> if ſhe propoſes ſuch <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies</hi> to the People, in which this Charge is given ſo home, and yet does not believe it her ſelf. A man muſt be of <hi>Bays</hi>'s pitch to riſe up to this degree of Impudence. Upon the whole matter then, theſe points have been already determined, and were a part of our <hi>Doctrine</hi> enacted by <hi>Law:</hi> All that the <hi>Parliament</hi> did, was only to take theſe out of a great many more, that by this <hi>Teſt</hi> it might appear whether they who came into either <hi>Houſe</hi> were of that <hi>Religion</hi> or not; and now let our <hi>Reaſoner</hi> try what he can make out of this; or how he can juſtify the Scandal that he ſo boldly throws upon his Order, <hi>as if they had as much as in them lay deſtroyed the very being of a Chriſtian Church, and had profanely pawned the Biſhop to the Lord: and betrayed the Rights of the Church of</hi> England <hi>as by Law Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in particular, as well as of the Church Catholick in general. p.</hi> 8, 9. All this ſhews to whom he has pawned both the <hi>Biſhop</hi> and the <hi>Lord,</hi> and ſomething elſe too, which is both <hi>Conſcience</hi> and <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi> if he has any left. When one reflects on <hi>two</hi> of the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,</hi> that were of that Venerable Body, while this <hi>Act</hi> paſſed, whoſe Memory will be bleſſed in the preſent and following Ages, thoſe two great and good Men that filled the <hi>Sees</hi> of <hi>Cheſter</hi> and <hi>Oxford,</hi> he muſt conclude, that as the World was not worthy of them, ſo certainly their <hi>Sees</hi> were nor worthy of them, ſince they have been plagued with ſuch <hi>Succeſſors;</hi> that becauſe <hi>Bays</hi> delights in figures taken from the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, I muſt tell him, that ſince <hi>Commodus</hi> ſucceeded to <hi>Marcus Aurillius,</hi> I do not find a more incongrous Succeſſion in Hiſtory. With what ſenſible regret muſt thoſe who were ſo often edified with the Gravity, the Piety, the Generoſity, and Charity of the
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:101251:107"/> late <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Oxford,</hi> look on, when they ſee ſuch a <hi>Harleguin</hi> in his room.</p>
            <p>His Fourth Reaſon is taken from the <hi>uncertainty and falſehood of the matters contained in the Declaration it ſelf,</hi> pag. 9. for our <hi>Comedian</hi> maintains his Character ſtill, and ſcorns to ſpeak of Eſtabliſh'd Laws with any Decency; here he puts in a para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph, as was formally marked, which belonged to his Second Reaſon, but it ſeems ſome of thoſe to whom he has <hi>pawn'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> thought he had not ſaid enough on that head, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to ſave blottings, he put it in here. After that, he tells the Gentry, that <hi>Tranſubſtantiation was a Notion belonging to the School-men and Metaphyſitians,</hi> and that he may beſpeak their Favour, he tells them in very ſoft words, <hi>That their Learning was more polite and practicable in the Civil Affairs of Human Life, to underſtand the Rules of Honour, and the Laws of their Countrey, the Practice of Martial Diſcipline, and the Examples of Great Men in former Ages, and by them to ſquare their Actions in their reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Stations, and the like.</hi> But ſure the <hi>Biſhop</hi> is here without his <hi>Fiocco,</hi> yet at leaſt for Decency's ſake he ſhould have named <hi>Religion and Virtue</hi> among the proper Studies of the Gentry: and if he dares not truſt them with the reading the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> yet at leaſt they might read the <hi>Articles of our Church,</hi> and hearken to the <hi>Homilies;</hi> for tho it has been long one of the firſt Maxims that he has infuſed into all the <hi>Clergy</hi> that come near him, that the People ought to be brought into an ignorance in matters of <hi>Religion;</hi> that Preaching ought to be laid aſide, for a Preaching Church could not ſtand; that in <hi>Sermons</hi> no points of Doctrine ought to be explained, and that only the Rules of Human Life ought to be told the People; yet after all, they may read the <hi>ſhort Articles:</hi> and tho they were as blindly Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit as he would wiſh them to be, yet they would without more Enquiry, find <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> to be condemned in them. Next he Triumphs over the renouncing of it, <hi>pag.</hi> 11. <q rend="inline">as too bold and too prophane an Affront to Almighty God: when men Abjure a thing which it is morally impoſſible for them to underſtand.</q> And he appeals to the Members of both <hi>Houſes</hi> (whom in a fit of Reſpect he calls <hi>Honourable,</hi> after he had Reproach'd them all he could) <q rend="inline">if they have any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Idea or Notion in their minds, of the thing they here
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:101251:107"/> ſo Solemnly Renounce.</q> I do verily believe none of them have any diſtinct Notion of Tranſubſtantiation; and that it is not only <hi>Morally,</hi> but <hi>Phyſically impoſſible for them to underſtand it:</hi> But one would think that this is enough for declaring that they do not <hi>Believe</hi> it, ſince the TEST contains no declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on concerning <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> it ſelf, whether it is a True or a Falſe Doctrine: but only concerning the Belief of him that takes it. And if one can have <q rend="inline">no diſtinct Notion of it, ſo that it is morally impoſſible for him to underſtand it, he may very well declare <hi>That he does not believe it.</hi>
               </q> After a Farce of a ſlight Story, he concludes, that <hi>there ſeems to be nothing but a Prophane Levity in the whole matter: and a ſhameleſs abuſe put upon God and Religion, to carry on the Wicked Deſigns of a Rebel-Faction.</hi> For he cannot for his heart, abate an ace of his Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, even when he makes the <hi>King, Lords, and Commons,</hi> the ſubject of his Scorn. Certainly whatever his Character is, it ought not to be expected that a man who attacks all that is Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred under God and Chriſt, ſhould not be treated as he deſerves: it were a feeble weakneſs, to have ſo great a regard to a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter that is ſo proſtituted by him. He tells us pag 47. <q rend="inline">That all parties agree in the thing: and that they differ only in the word and manner:</q> and here he makes a long excurſion to ſhew his Learning, in tacking a great many things together, which paſſes with Ignorant Readers as a mark of his great Reading: whereas in this, as well as in all his other Books, in which any ſhews of Learning appear, thoſe who have ſearched into the Fountains, ſee that he does nothing but gather from the Collection of others: only he ſpoils them with the <hi>Levities</hi> of his <hi>Buffoon Stilo,</hi> and which is worſe, with his <hi>Diſ-ingenuity.</hi> I leave all theſe matters to be examined, by thoſe who have leiſure for it, and that think him worth their pains: But as for <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> the words that I have cited from out of our <hi>Articles,</hi> ſhew plainly that it is rejected in our <hi>Church,</hi> ſo that he is bound either to renounce it, or to renounce our <hi>Church:</hi> therefore all that ſhew he makes with our Hiſtory, comes to nothing, ſince whatever he may ſay with relation to <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth's Reign, it cannot be denied but they were Enacted by the Convocation in the beginning of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign, and they have been ever ſince, the Doctrine of our Church: ſo
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:101251:108"/> that without going further, this is now our <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and ſince <hi>Sa. Oxon</hi> carries the Authority of the <hi>Convocation</hi> ſo high, he will find the Original Record of theſe <hi>Articles</hi> in <hi>Corpus-Chriſti Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg</hi> in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> ſubſcribed by the Members of both Houſes, in which there is a much more Poſitive Deciſion, than is in the Prints, not only againſt <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> but againſt any <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral or Real Preſence of the Body and Blood of Chriſt in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> And if he will give himſelf ſcope, to rail at thoſe who ſuppreſſed this, I leave him to his Liberty. But here is the formal deciſion of this <hi>Church,</hi> and the pretending that there was no Evidence of <hi>Cranmer</hi>'s Opinion, but in an unknown <hi>Manuſcript,</hi> or a Famous <hi>Inviſible Manuſcript,</hi> p. 49, 47. when there are two Books writ on this matter by <hi>Cranmer</hi> himſelf, and when all the Diſputes in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s time, beſides thoſe that were both in <hi>Oxford,</hi> and <hi>Cambridge,</hi> in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s time, ſhew ſo clearly, That this was his Doctrine, is a ſtrain becoming his Sincerity, that gives this among many other Eſſays of the Truſt that is due to him.</p>
            <p>But it ſeems he thought that Dr. <hi>Tillotſon,</hi> Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Burnet,</hi> beſides ſome others whom he does not Name, had not Reputation enough in the World, and therefore he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to raiſe it, by uſing them ill: which is all the effect that his Malice can have. He had ſet on one of his poor underwork<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, ſome years ago, to decry the <hi>Manuſcript</hi> which Dr. <hi>Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingfleet</hi> had in his keeping for above Twenty Years, and which Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> had in his Hands, for many months, and which they ſhewed to as many as deſired to ſee it, but that had turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo much to his Shame that firſt vented the Calumny, that it ſeems he ſummoned <hi>Sa. Oxon</hi> to appear his ſecond in the Slander: and he whoſe Brow is of ſo peculiar a Compoſition, will needs bring it here, tho ever ſo impertinently. But I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give the Hatred that he bears both to that <hi>Manuſcript,</hi> and to thoſe <hi>Doctors,</hi> ſince nothing could be leſs to <hi>the ſatisfacton of thoſe for whom he publiſhed his Book,</hi> than to ſee the Mature and Regular Methods in which the <hi>Reformation</hi> was advanced, for the <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Divines</hi> were appointed to Examine all Points with much care, and to bring every man his Opinion in Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, all which were compared very faithfully, and upor theſe the Deciſions were made.</p>
            <pb n="211" facs="tcp:101251:108"/>
            <p>There are many other Papers yet extant which by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Hands ſhew theſe to be Originals: and they were in the <hi>Salisbury</hi> Family probably ever ſince they were at firſt brought together. Their Anceſtor the Lord <hi>Burleigh</hi> who was <hi>Secretary of State</hi> in <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth's time, gathered them up; and as appears in a Letter under his own Hand yet extant, he had 6 or 7 <hi>Volumns</hi> of them, of which Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> had only <hi>two:</hi> but Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> ſaw two more of theſe Volumes.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Hiſtory of the Reformation</hi> ſells ſtill ſo well, that I do not believe Mr. <hi>Chiſwell</hi> the Printer of it has made any Preſent to this Reaſoner, to raiſe its Price; for to attack it with ſo much Malice, and'yet not to offer one Reaſon to leſſen its Credit, is as effectual a Recommendation, as this Author can give it.</p>
            <p>He pretends that Dr. <hi>Burnet's</hi> deſign was, to make <hi>Cranmer</hi> appear a meer <hi>Sacramentarian</hi> as to <hi>Doctrine,</hi> as he had made him appear an <hi>Eraſtian,</hi> as to <hi>Diſcipline;</hi> and he thinks the <hi>vain Man</hi> was flattered into all the Pains he took, that he might give Reputation to the Errours of his Patrons, and that thoſe two <hi>grand Forgeries</hi> are the grand Singularities of his <hi>Hiſtory:</hi> and the main things that gave it Popular Vogue and Reputation with his <hi>Party.</hi> So that were theſe two blind Stories, and the Reaſons depending upon them retrenched, it would be like the ſhaving off <hi>Samſons</hi> Hair, and deſtroy all the ſtrength pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to the Hiſtory. But to all this ſtuff I ſhall only ſay. 1. That the Charge of <hi>Forgery</hi> falls back on the Reaſoner, ſince as to <hi>Cranmers</hi> opinion of the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> his own Books and his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute at <hi>Oxford</hi> are ſuch plain Evidences, that none but <hi>Bays</hi> could have queſtioned it; and for his being an <hi>Eraſtian</hi> Dr. <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net</hi> had clearly proved that he had changed his Opinion in that Point, ſo that tho he ſhewed that he had been indeed once en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in thoſe Opinions, yet he proved that he had forſaken them: Let the Reader judg to whom the charge of <hi>Forgery</hi> belongs. 2. Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> has indeed ſome temptations to <hi>Vanity</hi> now, ſince he is ill uſed by <hi>Bays;</hi> and put in ſuch Company: but I dare ſay if he goes to give him his Character he will never mention ſo ſlight a one as <hi>Vanity,</hi> in which how exceſſive ſo ever he may be, yet it is the ſmalleſt of all his Faults. 3. Theſe two Particulars here mentioned, bear ſo inconſiderable a ſhare in that <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> and have been ſo little minded, that I dare ſay
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:101251:109"/> of an hundred that are pleaſed with that Work, there is not one that will aſſign theſe as their Motives.</p>
            <p>He cenſures Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> for ſaying <hi>he had often heard it ſaid that the Articles of our Church were framed by</hi> Cranmer <hi>and</hi> Rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, <hi>as if it were the meaneſt Trade of an Hiſtorian to ſtoop to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſays,</hi> p. 55. But the beſt of all the <hi>Roman Hiſtorians (Saluſt. in bello Catil.)</hi> does it, and in this Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> maintains the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a ſincere Hiſtorian, to ſay nothing that was not well grounded: and ſince it has been often ſaid by many Writers, that theſe <hi>two Biſhops</hi> prepared our <hi>Articles,</hi> he finding no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Evidence of that, delivers it with its own doubtfulneſs. It is very like <hi>Sa. Oxon</hi> would have been more poſitive upon half the grounds that Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> had, but the other choſe to write exactly: yet he adds, That it is probable that they penned them: and if either the Dignity of their <hi>Sees,</hi> or of their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons be conſidered, the thing will appear reaſonable enough. But I do not wonder to ſee any thing that looks like a modeſty of Stile offend our Author. He is next ſo kind to Dr. <hi>Burnet,</hi> as to offer him ſome Counſel, (p. 50.) <hi>that he would be well adviſed to imploy his Pains in writing Lampoons upon the preſent Princes of Chriſtendom (eſpecially his own) which he delights in moſt; becauſe it is the worſt thing that himſelf can do; than collecting the Records of former times; for the firſt will require time and Poſtage, to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue his Malice; but the ſecond is eaſily traced in the Chimney-corner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One would think that this period was Writ by Mr. <hi>South,</hi> it is ſo obſcure and ill expreſſed, that nothing is plain, but the malice of it: but he of all men ſhould be the furtheſt from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching any for Writing <hi>Lampoons,</hi> who has now given ſo rude a one, on the late <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons;</hi> if bold Railing without either Wit or Decency, deſerves that Name. I will only ſay this further, That if one had the ill nature to write a <hi>Lampoon</hi> on the Government, one of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereſt Articles in it, would be, That it ſeems Writers are hard to be found, when ſuch a <hi>Baboon</hi> is made uſe of. It is <hi>Lampoon</hi> enough upon the Age, that he is a <hi>Biſhop,</hi> but it is downright <hi>Reproach</hi> that he is made the <hi>Champion</hi> of a Cauſe, which if it is bad of it ſelf, muſt ſuffer extreamly by being in ſuch Hands.</p>
            <pb n="213" facs="tcp:101251:109"/>
            <p>And thus I think enough is ſaid in Anſwer to his impertinent digreſſion upon <hi>Tranſubſtantiation;</hi> let him renounce the <hi>Article</hi> of our <hi>Church,</hi> and all that he poſſeſſes in Conſequence to his having ſigned it, and then we will argue all the reſt with him upon the ſquare: but as long as he owns that, he is bound likewiſe to own the firſt Branch of the TEST, which is the Renouncing of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation.</hi> In this Diſcourſe he makes his old hatred to <hi>Calvin</hi> and the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> return ſo often, that it appears very Conſpicuouſly. I believe it is ſtronger now than ever, and that for a particular reaſon; when the <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Princeſs</hi> of <hi>Orange</hi> were Married, he was perhaps the only Man in <hi>England</hi> that Expreſſed his uneaſineſs at that Happy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction, in ſo Clowniſh a manner, that when their <hi>Highneſſes</hi> paſt through <hi>Canterbury,</hi> he would not go with the reſt of that Body, to which he was ſo long a Blemiſh, to pay his Duty to them; and when he was asked the Reaſon, he ſaid, <hi>He could have no regard to a Calviniſt Prince.</hi> Now this <hi>Calviniſt Prince</hi> has declared his mind ſo openly and fully againſt the <hi>Repeal of the TEST,</hi> that no doubt this has encreaſed <hi>Bays</hi>'s diſtemper, and heightned his Choler againſt the whole Party.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Branch of the TEST is the Declaration made of the <hi>Idolatry committed in the Roman Church;</hi> upon which he tells us, p. 71, 72. That <hi>Idolatry is a Stabbing and Cut-throat Word, and that it is an Inviting and Warranting the Rabble when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Opportunity favours, to deſtroy the Roman Catholicks;</hi> and here <hi>Bays</hi> will outdo himſelf, ſince this was a Maſter-piece of Service; therefore he makes the taxing the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> with Idolatry, <hi>a piece of Inhumanity that outdoes the Savages of the Canibals themſelves: and damns at once both body and Soul.</hi> He charges Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> as the <hi>great Founder of this, and all other Anti-catholick and Anti-chriſtian and uncharitable Principles among us; and that the TEST is the Swearing to the Truth of his unlearned and Phanatick Notion of Idolatry,</hi> pag. 130, 135. and the reſult of all is, <hi>That Idolatry made the Plot, and then the Plot made Idolatry, and that the ſame perſons made both.</hi> He has alſo troubled the Reader with a ſecond impertinence to ſhew his ſecond-hand Reading again upon the Notion of <hi>Idolatry:</hi> but all this falls off with a very ſhort Anſwer, if he is of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> and believes that the <hi>Homilies contain a
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:101251:110"/> Godly and Wholeſom Doctrine,</hi> all this Clamour againſt <hi>Idolatry,</hi> turns againſt himſelf, for he will find the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with this almoſt an Age before Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> was Born: and tho perhaps none has ever defended the <hi>Charge,</hi> with ſo much Learning as he has done, yet no malice leſs Impudent than his is, could make him the Author of the Accuſation. It will be another ſtrain of our Author's modeſty, if he will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that our Church is not bound to own the Doctrine that is contained in her <hi>Homilies,</hi> he muſt by this make our Church as Treacherous to her Members, as <hi>Sa. Oxon</hi> is to her; for to deliver this Doctrine to the People, if we believe it not our ſelves, is to be as impudent as he himſelf can pretend to be. A Church may believe a Doctrine which ſhe does not think neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to propoſe to all her Members: but ſhe were indeed a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety fit for ſuch Paſtors as he is, if ſhe could propoſe to the People a Doctrine, chiefly one of ſo great Conſequence as this is, without ſhe believed it her ſelf. So then he muſt either Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce our Church and her <hi>Articles,</hi> or he muſt Anſwer all his own Plea for clearing that Church of this Imputation: which is ſo ſlight, that it will be no hard matter even for ſuch a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling Writer as himſelf is, to do it: As for what he ſays of Stab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing and Cut-throat Words, he may charge us with ſuch words, if he will, but we know who we may charge with the Deeds I would gladly ſee the Liſt of all that have been murder'd by theſe Words, to try if they can be put in the Ballance, either with the <hi>Maſſacre</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> or that of <hi>Paris;</hi> upon which I muſt take notice of his flight way of mentioning <hi>Coligny, and Faction,</hi> and telling us in plain words, pag. 45. <q rend="inline">That they were Rebels.</q> This is perhaps another inſtance of his kindneſs to the <hi>Calviniſt Prince,</hi> that is Deſcended from that Great Man.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Idolatry made our Plot,</hi> it was not the firſt that it made; but his malignity is ſtill like himſelf, his charging Dr. <hi>Stilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleet,</hi> who he ſays is the Author of the Imputation of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> as if he had ſuborned the <hi>Evidence in our Plot.</hi> I ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate to the Doctor the Honour that is done him by the Malice of one who muſt needs be the object of the hatred of all good Men, if I did not look upon him as ſo contemptible a perſon, that his love and his hatred are equally inſignificant.
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:101251:110"/> If he thinks our Church worſe than Canibals, I wiſh he would be at the pains to go and make a trial, and ſee whether theſe Salvages will uſe him as we have done. I dare ſay they would not Eat him, for they would find ſo much Gall and Choler in him, that the firſt bit would quite diſguſt them.</p>

            <head>A ſecond Part of the <hi>ENQUIRY</hi> into the Reaſons offered by <hi>Sa. Oxon</hi> for Abrogating the <hi>TEST:</hi> Or an Anſwer to his Plea for <hi>Tranſubſtantiation;</hi> and for Acquitting the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> of <hi>IDOLATRY.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE two ſeemingly contrary Advices of the <hi>Wiſe man,</hi> of <hi>Anſwering a Fool according to his Folly,</hi> and of <hi>not Anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him according to his Folly,</hi> are founded on ſuch Excellent Reaſons, that if a man can but rightly diſtinguiſh the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, he has a good Warrant for uſing both upon different occaſions. The Reaſon for <hi>Anſwering a Fool according to his Folly,</hi> is, <hi>lest he be wiſe in his own eyes;</hi> that ſo a haughty and petulant humour may be ſubdued; and that a Man that is both blinded and ſwelled up with ſelf-conceit, may by ſo ſevere a Remedy be brought to know himſelf, and to think as mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of himſelf as every Body elſe does. But the reaſon againſt <hi>Anſwering a Fool according to his Folly,</hi> is, <hi>leſt one be alſo like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him,</hi> and ſo let both his mind and ſtile be corrupted by ſo Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious a Pattern. Since then in a former <hi>Paper,</hi> I was wrought on to let our Author ſee, what a ſevere Treatment he has juſtly drawn on himſelf, and to write in a ſtile a little like his own; I will now let him ſee, that he is the Man in the World, whom I deſire the leaſt to reſemble: and ſo if I writ before in a ſtile that I thought became him, I will now change that into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which I am ſure becomes my ſelf. In the former, I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined his Arguments for abrogating the <hi>Teſt,</hi> in a ſtrain, which I thought ſomewhat neceſſary for the Informing the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:101251:111"/> aright, in a matter of ſuch Conſequence, that the Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of our <hi>Religion</hi> is judged to depend upon it, by the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptive <hi>Heir</hi> of the Crown: but now, that I am to argue a point, which requires more of a Gravity, than of an acrimony of ſtile, I will no more conſider the <hi>Man,</hi> but the <hi>Matter</hi> in hand.</p>
            <p>In a word, <q rend="inline">He would perſuade the World, that <hi>Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation</hi> is but a Nicety of the Schools, calculated to the <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotelian</hi> Philoſophy, and not defined poſitively in the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> but that the <hi>Corporal</hi> and <hi>Real Preſence</hi> of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Chriſt's <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> in the Sacrament, was the Doctrine of the Univerſal <hi>Church</hi> in the Primitive Times: and that it is at this day the generally received Doctrine by all the different Parties in <hi>Europe,</hi> not only the <hi>Ro. Catholicks</hi> and <hi>Lutherans,</hi> but both by the Churches of <hi>Switzerland</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> and more particularly by the Church of <hi>England;</hi> ſo that ſince all that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> means by Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation is the <hi>Real Preſence;</hi> and ſince the <hi>Real Preſence</hi> is ſo U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſally received, it is a heinous thing to renounce Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation; for that is in effect the renouncing the <hi>Real Preſence.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This is the whole ſtrength of his Argument, which he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifies by many Citations, to prove that both the Ancient <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> and the Modern <hi>Reformers,</hi> believed the <hi>Real Preſence;</hi> and that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> believes no more. But to all this I ſhall offer a few Exceptions.</p>
            <p n="1">I. If <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> is only a Philoſophical Nicety concerning the <hi>manner</hi> of the <hi>Preſence;</hi> where is the hurt of renouncing it? and why are the <hi>Ro. Catholicks</hi> at ſo much pains to have the <hi>Teſt</hi> repealed? for it contains nothing againſt the <hi>Real Preſence;</hi> indeed if this Argument has any force, it ſhould rather lead the <hi>Ro. Catholicks</hi> to take the <hi>Test,</hi> ſince according to the Bp. they do not renounce in it any Article of Faith, but only a bold curioſity of the Schoolmen. Yet after all, it ſeems they know, that this is contrary to their Doctrine, otherwiſe they would not venture ſo much upon a point of an old and decried Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy.</p>
            <pb n="217" facs="tcp:101251:111"/>
            <p n="2">II. In order to the ſtating this matter aright, it is neceſſary to give the true notion of the <hi>Real Preſence,</hi> as it is acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the <hi>Reformed.</hi> We all know in what ſenſe the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> underſtands it, that in the <hi>Sacrament</hi> there is no <hi>Real Bread and Wine,</hi> but that under the appearance of them, we have the true ſubſtance of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> glorified <hi>Body.</hi> On the other hand, the <hi>Reformed,</hi> when they found the world generally fond of this phraſe; they by the ſame Spirit of Compliance, which our Saviour and his Apoſtles had for the <hi>Jews,</hi> and that the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church had (perhaps to exceſs) for the <hi>Heathens,</hi> retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the phraſe of <hi>Real Preſence:</hi> but as they gave it ſuch a ſenſe as did fully demonſtrate, that tho they retained a term that had for it a long Preſcription, yet they quite changed its meaning: for they always ſhewed, that the <hi>Body and Blood of Chriſt,</hi> which they believed preſent, was his <hi>Body broken</hi> and his <hi>Blood ſhed;</hi> that is to ſay, his <hi>Body,</hi> not in its <hi>glorified ſtate,</hi> but as it was <hi>crucified.</hi> So that the preſence belonging to Chriſt's <hi>dead Body,</hi> which is not now actually in being, it is only his <hi>Death</hi> that is to be conceived to be preſented to us; and this being the ſenſe that they always give of the <hi>Real Preſence,</hi> the <hi>reality</hi> falls only on that conveyance that is made to us in the Sacrament, by a federal rite of <hi>Chriſt's Death</hi> as our <hi>Sacrifice.</hi> The learned Anſwerer to the <hi>Oxford</hi> Diſcourſes has ſo fully demonſtrated this from the copious explanations which all the <hi>Reformed</hi> give of that phraſe, that one would think it were not poſſible either to miſtake or cavil in ſo clear a point. The <hi>Papiſts</hi> had gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally objected to the <hi>Reformers,</hi> that they made the <hi>Sacrament</hi> no more than a bare Commemoratory Feaſt; and ſome few had carried their averſion to that groſs <hi>Preſence</hi> which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> had ſet up, to another extream to which the People by a principle of Libertiniſm might have been too eaſily carried; if the true Dignity of the Sacrament had not been maintained by expreſſions of great Majeſty: ſo finding that the world was poſſeſſed of the phraſe of the <hi>Real Preſence,</hi> they thought fit to preſerve it, but with an Explanation that was lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to no Ambiguity. Yet it ſeems our <hi>Reformers</hi> in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign had found that the phraſe had more power to carry men to Superſtition, than the explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions given to it, had to retire them from it, and therefore the
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:101251:112"/> Convocation ordered it to be laid aſide, tho that order was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed out of prudence: and the phraſe has been ever ſince in uſe among us, of which Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> has given us a copious ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, <hi>Hiſt. Reform.</hi> 2. Vol. 3. Book.</p>
            <p n="3">III. The Difference between the notion of the <hi>Sacrament's</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a meer Commemoratory Feaſt, and the <hi>Real Preſence,</hi> is an great as the value of the Kings head ſtamped upon a Medal differs from the currant coyn, or the Impreſſion made by the Great Seal upon Wax differs from that which any Carver or Graver may make. The one is a meer <hi>Memorial,</hi> but the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther has a ſacred badge of Authority in it. The <hi>Paſchal Lamb</hi> was not only a <hi>Remembrance</hi> of the Deliverance of the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> but a continuance of the <hi>Covenant</hi> that <hi>Moſes</hi> made between God and them, which diſtinguiſhed them from all the Nations round about them, as well as the firſt <hi>Paſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over</hi> had diſtinguiſhed them from the <hi>Egyptians.</hi> Now it were a ſtrange Inference, becauſe the <hi>Lamb</hi> was called the <hi>Lords Paſſeover,</hi> that is, the <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> upon the ſprinkling of whoſe Blood the Angel <hi>paſſed over</hi> or <hi>paſſed</hi> by the Houſes of the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,</hi> when he ſmote the firſt-born of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> to ſay, that there was a change of the ſubſtance of the <hi>Lamb:</hi> or becauſe the Real ſaith of a Prince is given by his Great Seal, printed on Wax, and affixed to a Parchment, that therefore the ſubſtance of the Wax is changed: ſo it is no leſs abſurd to imagine, that becauſe the Bread and the Wine are ſaid to be the <hi>Body and Blood of Chriſt</hi> as <hi>broken</hi> and <hi>ſhed,</hi> that is, his death <hi>Really</hi> and <hi>effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi> offered to us, as our <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> that therefore the ſubſtance of the <hi>Bread and Wine</hi> are changed.</p>
            <p>And thus upon the whole matter, that which is preſent in the Sacrament is Chriſt <hi>Dead,</hi> and ſince his death was tranſacted above 1600. years ago, the reality of his preſence can be no other than a Real offer of his death made to us in an inſtituted and federal ſymbole. I have explained this the more fully, becauſe with this, all the ambiguity in the uſe of that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly received phraſe, falls off.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. As for the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the Ancient Church, there has been ſo much ſaid in this <hi>Enquiry,</hi> that a Man cannot hope to add any new diſcoveries to what has been already found out: therefore I ſhall only endeavour to bring ſome of the moſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:101251:112"/> Obſervations into a narrow compaſs, and to ſet them in a good light: and ſhall firſt offer ſome general <hi>Preſumptions,</hi> to ſhew that it is not like, that this was the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive times, and then ſome Poſitive proof of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is no ſlight <hi>Preſumption</hi> againſt it, that we do not find the <hi>Fathers</hi> take any pains to anſwer the Objections that do na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally ariſe out of the preſent Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> theſe Objections do not ariſe out of profound ſtudy, or great learning, but from the plain dictates of common ſenſe, which make it hard (to ſay no more) for us to believe, <hi>that a Body can be in more places than one at once, and that it can be in a place after the manner of a ſpirit: that Accidents can be without their ſubject; or that our ſenſes can deceive us in the plaineſt caſes:</hi> We find the <hi>Fathers</hi> explain ſome abſtruſe difficulties that ariſe out of other Myſteries, that were leſs known, and were more Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative: and while they are thought perhaps to over-do the one, it is a little ſtrange that they ſhould never touch the other: but on the contrary, when they treat of Philoſophical matters, they expreſs themſelves roundly in oppoſition to thoſe conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of this Doctrine: whereas ſince this Doctrine has been received, we ſee all the ſpeculations of Philoſophy have been ſo managed, as to keep a reſerve for this Doctrine. So that the uncautious way in which the Fathers handled them (in proof of which, Volumes of quotations can be made) ſhews they had not then received that <hi>Doctrine,</hi> which muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity give them occaſion to write otherwiſe than they did.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We find the <hi>Heathens</hi> ſtudied to load the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> with all the heavieſt Imputations that they could give it. They objected to them the believing a God that was born, and that died, and the Reſurrection of the Dead, and many leſſer mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which ſeemed abſurd to them; they had malice enough to ſeek out every thing that could diſgrace a <hi>Religion</hi> which grew too hard for them: but they never once object this, of <hi>making a God out of a piece of Bread, and then eating him:</hi> if this had been the Doctrine of thoſe Ages, the <hi>Heathens,</hi> chiefly <hi>Celſus,</hi> and <hi>Porphiry,</hi> but above all <hi>Julian,</hi> could not have been Ignorant of it. Now it does not ſtand with common ſenſe to think, that thoſe who inſiſt much upon Inconſiderable things, could have paſſed over this, which is both ſo ſenſible and
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:101251:113"/> of ſuch Importance, if it had been the received belief of thoſe Ages.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is alſo of weight, that there were no diſputes nor He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies upon this point during the firſt Ages; and that none of the <hi>Hereticks</hi> ever objected it to the <hi>Doctors</hi> of the Church. We find they contended about all other Points: now this has ſo many difficulties in it, that it ſhould ſeem a little ſtrange, that all mens underſtandings ſhould have been then ſo eaſy and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting, that this was the ſingle point of the whole Body of Divinity, about which the Church had no diſpute for the firſt <hi>Seven</hi> Centuries. It therefore inclines a Man rather to think, that becauſe there was no diſputes concerning it, therefore it was not then broached: ſince we ſee plainly, that ever ſince it was broached in the <hi>Weſt,</hi> it has occaſioned laſting Diſputes, both with thoſe who could not be brought to believe it, and with one another concerning the ſeveral ways of explaining and maintaining it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It is alſo a ſtrong <hi>Prejudice</hi> againſt the Antiquity of this Doctrine, that there were none of thoſe rites in the firſt Ages, which have crept in, in the latter: which were ſuch natural conſequences of it, that the belief of the one making way for the other, we may conclude, that where the one were not practiſed, the other was not believed. I will not mention all the Pomp which the latter Ages have Invented to raiſe the lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtre of this <hi>Doctrine,</hi> with which the former Ages were unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted. It is enough to obſerve, that the <hi>Adoration</hi> of the Sacrament, was ſuch a neceſſary Conſequence of this <hi>Doctrine,</hi> that ſince the Primitive Times know nothing of it, as the <hi>Greek</hi> Church does not to this day, it is perhaps more than a <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption,</hi> that they believed it not.</p>
            <p n="5">5. But now I come to more Poſitive and Convincing proofs: and</p>
            <p n="1">1. The language of the whole Church is only to be found in the <hi>Liturgies</hi> which are more ſeverely compoſed than Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torical Diſcourſes; and of all the parts of the Office, the <hi>Prayer of Conſecration,</hi> is that in which we muſt hope to find moſt certainly the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the Church; we find them in the 4th <hi>Century,</hi> that in the Prayer of Conſecration, the <hi>Elements</hi> were ſaid to be the <hi>Types of the Body and Blood of Chriſt,</hi> as St. <hi>Baſil</hi>
               <pb n="221" facs="tcp:101251:113"/> Informs us from the <hi>Greek Liturgies;</hi> and <hi>the Figure of his Body and Blood,</hi> as St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> Informs us, from the <hi>Latine Liturgies:</hi> The <hi>Prayer</hi> of <hi>Conſecration,</hi> that is now in the <hi>Canon</hi> of the <hi>Maſs,</hi> is in a great part the ſame with that which is cited by St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> but with this Important difference, that inſtead of the words, <hi>which is the Figure of the Body and Blood of Chriſt,</hi> that are in the former, there is a petition added in the latter, that <hi>the gifts may be to us the Body and Blood of Chriſt.</hi> If we had ſo many of the Maſſes of the Ancient <hi>Liturgies</hi> left, as to be able to find out the time in which the <hi>Prayer</hi> of <hi>Conſecration</hi> was altered, from what it was in St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi>'s days, to what it is now, this would be no ſmall Article in the <hi>Hiſtory of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation:</hi> but moſt of theſe are loſt; ſince then the Ancient Church could not believe otherwiſe of the Sacrament, than as ſhe expreſſed her ſelf concerning it, in the <hi>Prayer of Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> It is plain, that her firſt <hi>Doctrine</hi> concerning it, was, that the <hi>Bread and Wine were the Types and the Figure of the Body and Blood of Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. A ſecond proof is from the Controverſy, that was began by the <hi>Apollinariſts,</hi> and carried on by the <hi>Eutichians,</hi> whether Chriſt's humanity was ſwallowed up of his Divinity or not? The <hi>Eutichians</hi> made uſe of the General Expreſſions, by which the change in the <hi>Sacrament</hi> ſeemed to be carried ſo far, that the Bread and Wine were ſwallowed up by it; and from this they inferred, that in like manner the human nature of Chriſt was ſwallowed up by his Divinity: but in oppoſition to all this, we find <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> the Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople, Ephraim</hi> the Patriarch of <hi>Antioch, Gelaſius</hi> the Pope, <hi>Theodoret</hi> a Biſhop in <hi>Aſia</hi> the leſſer, and <hi>Facundus</hi> a Biſhop in <hi>Africk,</hi> all within the compaſs of little more than an Age, agree almoſt in the ſame words, in refuting all this: aſſerting, <hi>that as the human nature in Chriſt remained ſtill the ſame that it was before, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding its union with his Divine Nature; even ſo the Bread and Wine retained ſtill their former</hi> Nature, Subſtance and Form, and that <hi>they are only ſanctified, not by the change of their</hi> Nature, <hi>but by adding Grace to Nature.</hi> This they do in terms plain, and beyond all exception; and <hi>Theodoret</hi> goes over the matter again and again, in two different Treatiſes; ſo that no matter of fact can appear more plainly, than that the whole Church <hi>Eaſt</hi>
               <pb n="222" facs="tcp:101251:114"/> and <hi>Weſt,</hi> and <hi>South,</hi> did in the fifth and ſixth <hi>Centuries</hi> believe that the Sanctification of the <hi>Elements</hi> in the Sacrament, did no more deſtroy their natures, than the union of the two Natures in Chriſt, did deſtroy his humane nature.</p>
            <p>A Third proof is taken from a practice which I will not offer to juſtify, how Ancient ſoever it may have been: It appears in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in the Ancienteſt <hi>Liturgies</hi> now extant; and is a <hi>Prayer</hi> in which the <hi>Sacrament</hi> is ſaid to be offered up in <hi>honour of the Saint of the day,</hi> to which a petition is added, that it may be <hi>accepted of God, by the Interceſſion of the Saint.</hi> This is yet in the <hi>Miſſal,</hi> and is uſed upon moſt of the Saints days. Now if the Sacrament was then believed to be the <hi>very Body and Blood of Chriſt,</hi> there is nothing more <hi>crude,</hi> not to ſay <hi>prophanc,</hi> to offer this up to the <hi>honour of a Saint,</hi> and to pray that the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Chriſt's Body may be accepted of God through the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion of a <hi>Saint.</hi> Therefore to give any tollerable ſenſe to theſe words, we muſt conclude, that tho theſe Prayers have been continued in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church ſince this Opinion pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, yet they were never made in an Age in which it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. The only meaning that can be given to theſe words, is, that they made the <hi>Saints days,</hi> days of Communion, as well as the <hi>Sundays</hi> were; and upon that they prayed that the Sacrament which they received that day, to do the more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to the Memory of the Saint, might be recommended to the Divine Acceptance by the Interceſſion of the Saint: ſo that this Superſtitious practice ſhews plainly, that the <hi>Church</hi> had not, even when it began, received the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the change of the Elements into the Body and Blood of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>I will not purſue the proof of this point further, nor will I enter into a particular recital of the Sayings of the <hi>Fathers</hi> upon this ſubject; which would carry me far: And it is done ſo copiouſly by others, that I had rather refer my Reader to them, than offer him a lean abridgement of their labours.</p>
            <p>I ſhall only add, that the <hi>Preſumptions</hi> and Proofs that I have offered are much more to be valued, than the Pious and Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torical Figures by which many of the <hi>Fathers</hi> have ſet forth the manner of Chriſt's <hi>Preſence</hi> in the Sacrament. One thing is plain, that in moſt of them, they repreſent Chriſt preſent in his dead and crucified ſtate, which appears moſt eminently in St <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom;</hi>
               <pb n="223" facs="tcp:101251:114"/> ſo that this agreed with that notion of a <hi>Real Preſence,</hi> that was formerly explained. Men that have at the ſame time, all the heat in their Imaginations that Eloquence can raiſe, and all the fervour in their heart which devotion can inſpire, are ſeldom ſo correct in their phraſes and figures, as not to need ſome allowances: therefore one plain proof of their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions from their Reaſonings when in cold blood, ought to be of much more weight than all their Tranſports and Amplifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations.</p>
            <p>From this General view of the State of the <hi>Church</hi> during the firſt <hi>Centuries,</hi> I come next to conſider the ſteps of the change which was afterwards made. I will not offer to trace out that Hiſtory, which Mr. <hi>Larrogue</hi> has done Copiouſly, whom I the rather mention, becauſe he is put in <hi>Engliſh.</hi> I ſhall only obſerve, that by reaſon of the high expreſſions which were uſed upon the occaſion of the <hi>Eutichean</hi> Controverſy, formerly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, by which the Sanctification of the <hi>Elements</hi> was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the Union of the humane nature of Chriſt with his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, a great ſtep was made to all that followed: during the Diſpute concerning <hi>Images,</hi> thoſe who oppoſed the worſhip of them ſaid, according to all the Ancient Liturgies, that they indeed acknowledged one <hi>Image</hi> of Chriſt, which was the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament;</hi> thoſe who promoted that piece of ſuperſtition (for I refer the calling it <hi>Idolatry</hi> to its proper place) had the Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to deny that it had ever been called the <hi>Image of Chriſt's Body and Blood:</hi> and ſaid, that it was really his <hi>Body and Blood.</hi> We will not much Diſpute concerning an Age, in which the World ſeemed mad with a zeal for the Worſhip of <hi>Images;</hi> and in which <hi>Rebellion,</hi> and the Depoſing of <hi>Princes</hi> upon the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Hereſy, began to be put in practice: ſuch times as theſe, we willingly yield up to our Adverſaries. Yet <hi>Dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcene,</hi> and the <hi>Greek</hi> Church after him, carried this matter no further than to aſſert an Aſſumption of the <hi>Elements,</hi> into an union with the <hi>Body and Blood of Chriſt.</hi> But when the Monk of <hi>Corbie</hi> began to carry the matter yet further, and to ſay, that the <hi>Elements</hi> were changed into the <hi>very body of Chriſt that was born of the Virgin,</hi> we find all the great men of that Age, both in <hi>France, Germany,</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> writ againſt him; and he himſelf owns that he was looked upon as an Innovator.
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:101251:115"/> Thoſe who writ againſt him, chiefly <hi>Rabanus Maurus,</hi> and <hi>Bertram,</hi> or <hi>Ratramne,</hi> did ſo plainly aſſert the Ancient opinion of the Sacraments being the <hi>Figure of the Body and Blood of Chriſt,</hi> that we cannot expreſs our ſelves more formally than they did: and from thence it was that our <hi>Saxon</hi> Homily on <hi>Eaſter</hi> Day was ſo expreſs in this point. Yet the War and the <hi>Northern</hi> Invaſions that followed, put the World into ſo much diſorder, that all Diſputes were ſoon forgot, and that in the Eleventh <hi>Century,</hi> this Opinion which had ſo many Partiſans in the Ninth, was generally decried, and much abandoned.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. But with relation to thoſe Ages in which it was received, ſome obſervations occur ſo readily, to every one that knows Hiſtory, that it is only for the ſake of the more Ignorant, that I make them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They were times of ſo much Ignorance, that it is ſcarce conceivable to any but to thoſe who have laboured a little in reading the productions of thoſe Ages; which is the drieſt piece of ſtudy I know: The ſtile in which they writ, and their way of arguing, and explaining Scripture, are all of a piece, both matter and form are equally barbarous. Now in ſuch times, as the Ignorant populace were eaſily miſled, ſo there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what in Incredible Stories and Opinions, that makes them paſs as eaſily, as men are apt to fancy they ſee Sprights in the Night: nay, the more of Myſtery and Darkneſs that there is in any Opinion, ſuch times are apt to cheriſh it the more for that very reaſon.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Thoſe were Ages in which the whole Eccleſiaſtical <hi>Order</hi> had entred into ſuch Conſpiracies againſt the <hi>State,</hi> which were managed and ſet on by ſuch vigour by the <hi>Popes,</hi> that every Opinion which tended to render the perſons of Churchmen <hi>Sacred,</hi> and to raiſe their Character, was likely to receive the beſt entertainment, and the greateſt encouragement poſſible. Nothing could ſo ſecure the perſons of <hi>Prieſts,</hi> and render them ſo conſiderable, as to believe <hi>that they made their God:</hi> and in ſuch Ages no Armour was of ſo ſure a proof as for a Prieſt to take his God in his hands.</p>
            <p>Now it is known, that as P. <hi>Gregory</hi> the 7th, who condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Berengarius,</hi> laid the foundations of the Eccleſiaſtical Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:101251:115"/> by eſtabliſhing the Depoſing Power; ſo P. <hi>Innocent</hi> the 3d. who got <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> to be decreed in the Fourth Council of the <hi>Lateran,</hi> ſeemed to have compleated the project, by the Addition made to the Depoſing Power, of transferring the Dominions of the Depoſed <hi>Prince</hi> to whom he pleaſed. Since before this, the Dominions muſt have gone to the next Heirs of the Depoſed Prince. It is then ſo plain, that the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> was ſo ſuitable to the advancing of thoſe ends, that it had been a wonder indeed, if it being once ſet on foot, it had not been eſtabliſhed in ſuch times.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thoſe Ages were ſo corrupt, and more particularly the <hi>Clergy,</hi> and chiefly the <hi>Popes,</hi> were by the Confeſſion of all Writers ſo exceſſively vicious, that ſuch men could have no regard to truth in any of their Deciſions. Intereſt muſt have carried all other things before it, with ſuch <hi>Popes,</hi> who, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Hiſtorians of their own Communion, were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the worſt men that ever lived. Their Vices were ſo cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that nothing but the credit that is due to the Writers of their own time, and their own Church, could determine us to believe them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. As the Ignorance and Vices of thoſe times derogate juſtly from all the credit that is due to them; ſo the Cruelty which followed their Deciſions, and which was Imployed in the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of them, makes it appear rather a ſtranger thing that ſo many oppoſed them, than that ſo many ſubmitted to them. When <hi>Inquiſitors</hi> or <hi>Dragoons</hi> manage an Argument, how <hi>ſtrong ſoever the Spirit</hi> may be, in oppoſing it, it is certain the <hi>Fleſh will be weak,</hi> and will ply eaſily. When <hi>Princes</hi> were threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with Depoſition, and <hi>Hereticks</hi> with Extirpation, and when both were executed with ſo much rigour, the ſucceſs of all the Doctrines that were eſtabliſhed in thoſe days, ought to make no Impreſſion on us, in its favour.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. It is no leſs plain that there was a great and vigorous oppoſition made to every ſtep of the progreſs of this Doctrine: When the <hi>Eutichians</hi> firſt made uſe of it, the greateſt men of that Age ſet themſelves againſt it. When the Worſhippers of <hi>Images</hi> did afterwards deny that the <hi>Sacrament</hi> was the <hi>Image of the Body and Blood of Chriſt,</hi> a General <hi>Council</hi> in the <hi>Eaſt</hi> aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, according to the Ancient <hi>Liturgies,</hi> the Contrary <hi>Propoſition.</hi>
               <pb n="226" facs="tcp:101251:116"/> When <hi>Paſchaſe Radbert</hi> ſet on Foot the <hi>Corporal Preſence,</hi> in the <hi>Weſt,</hi> all the great men of the Age writ againſt him. <hi>Beren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> was likewiſe highly eſteemed, and had many ſecret Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, when this Doctrine was firſt decreed: and ever ſince the time of the <hi>Council</hi> of the <hi>Lateran,</hi> that <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> was eſtabliſhed, there have been whole bodies of men that have oppoſed it, and that have fallen as Sacrifices to the Rages of the Inquiſitors. And by the Proceſſes of thoſe of <hi>Tholouſe,</hi> of which I have ſeen the Original <hi>Records,</hi> for the ſpace of Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years, it appears that as <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> was the Article upon which they were always chiefly examined, ſo it was that which many of them did the moſt conſtantly deny; ſo far were they on both ſides from looking on it only as an Expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the <hi>Real Preſence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">VIII. The Novelty of this <hi>Doctrine</hi> appears plainly by the ſtrange work that the <hi>Schools</hi> have made with it, ſince they got it among them, both in their Philoſophy and Divinity, and by the many different methods that they took for explaining it, till they had licked it into the ſhape in which it is now: which is as plain an Evidence of the Novelty of the Doctrine as can be imagined. The Learned Mr. <hi>Alix</hi> has given us a clear Dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of all that confuſion into which it has caſt the <hi>Schoolmen,</hi> and the many various Methods that they ſell on for maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. <hi>Firſt,</hi> they thought the Body of Chriſt was broken by the Teeth of the Faithful: then that appearing abſurd, and ſubjecting our Saviour to new ſufferings; the Doctrine of a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies being in a place after the manner of a ſpirit, was ſet up. And as to the change, ſome thought that the Matter of Bread remained, but that it was united to the Body of Chriſt, as nouriſhment is digeſted into our Bodies; others thought that the <hi>Form</hi> of Bread remained, the <hi>Matter</hi> only being changed: And ſome thought, that the <hi>Bread</hi> was only withdrawn to give place to the <hi>Body</hi> of Chriſt, whereas others thought it was Annihilated. While the better Judges had always an eye either to a <hi>Conſubſtantiation,</hi> or to ſuch an Aſſumption of the Bread and Wine by the Eternal Word, as made the Sacrament in ſome ſenſe his <hi>Body</hi> indeed; but not that Body which is now in Heaven. All theſe different Opinions, in which the <hi>School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> were divided, even after the Deciſion made by Pope <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,</hi>
               <pb n="227" facs="tcp:101251:116"/> in the Council of the <hi>Lateran,</hi> ſhew, that the <hi>Doctrine,</hi> being a Novelty, men did not yet know how to mould or form it, but in proceſs of time the whole Philoſophy was ſo digeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as to prepare all <hi>Scholars</hi> in their firſt formation to receive it the more eaſily. And in our Age, in which that Philoſophy has loſt its credit, what pains do they take to ſuppreſs the <hi>New</hi> Philoſophy, as ſeeing that it cannot be ſo eaſily ſubdued to ſupport this Doctrine as the <hi>Old</hi> one was. And it is no unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant thing to ſee the Shifts to which the Partiſans of the <hi>Carteſian</hi> Philoſophy are driven to explain themſelves; which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſo very ridiculous, that one can hardly think that thoſe who make uſe of them, believe them: for they are plainly ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Tricks and Excuſes, than Anſwers.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. No man can deny, that <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> is the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but he that will diſpute the Authority of the Councils of the <hi>Lateran</hi> and <hi>Trent:</hi> Now tho ſome have done the firſt avowedly, yet as their number is ſmall, and their Opinion decried; ſo for the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> tho I have known ſome of that Communion, who do not look upon it as a <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Council,</hi> and tho it is not at all received in <hi>France,</hi> neither as to Doctrine nor Diſcipline, yet the contrary opinion is ſo univerſally received, that they who think otherwiſe, dare not ſpeak out; and ſo give their Opinion as a ſecret, which they truſt in confidence, rather than as a Doctrine which they will own. But ſetting aſide the Authority of theſe <hi>Councils,</hi> the common Reſolution of Faith in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> being <hi>Tradition,</hi> it cannot be denied, that the conſtant and general Tradition in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> theſe laſt Five hundred years, has been in favour of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> and that is wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed by all the Evidences by which it is poſſible to know <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</hi> The Writings of Learned Men, the Sermons of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, the Poceedings of Tribunals, the Deciſions of Councils, that if they were not <hi>general,</hi> were yet very numerous, and above all by the many Authentical Declarations that <hi>Popes</hi> have made in this matter. So that either <hi>Tradition</hi> is to be for ever rejected as a falſe conveyance, or this is the received <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> from which She can never depart, without giving up both her <hi>Infallibility,</hi> and the Authority of <hi>Tradition.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="228" facs="tcp:101251:117"/>
            <p n="10">X. There is not any one point, in which all the <hi>Reformed Churches</hi> do more unanimouſly agree, than in the rejecting of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation:</hi> as appears both by the Harmony of their Conſeſſions, and by the current of all the Reformed VVriters. And for the <hi>Real Preſence,</hi> tho the <hi>Lutherans</hi> explain it by a <hi>Conſubſtantiation,</hi> and the reſt of the <hi>Reformed,</hi> by a Reality of Virtue and Efficacy, and a Preſence of Chriſt as crucified; yet all of them have taken much pains to ſhew, that in what ſenſe ſoever they meant it, they were ſtill far enough from <hi>Tranſubſtantiation.</hi> This demonſtrates the wiſdom of our <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlators,</hi> in ſingling out this to be the ſole point of the <hi>Teſt</hi> for Imployments; ſince it is perhaps the only point in Controverſy, in which the whole Church of <hi>Rome</hi> holds the Affirmative, and the whole <hi>Reformed</hi> hold the Negative. And it is as certain, that <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> is the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as that it is rejected by the Church of <hi>England;</hi> it being by name condemned in our <hi>Articles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus I hope the whole <hi>Plea</hi> of our Author in favour of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> is overthrown, in all its three Branches, which relate to the Doctrine of the <hi>Primitive Church,</hi> the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as well as of the other <hi>Reformed</hi> Churches. I have not loaded this Paper with Quotations; becauſe I intended to be ſhort: but I am ready to make good all the matters of fact aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted in it, under the higheſt pains of Infamy if I fail in the performance: and beſides, the more Voluminous works that have been writ on this ſubject, ſuch as <hi>Albertine</hi>'s, <hi>Claud</hi>'s An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> and F. <hi>Nonet, Larrogue</hi>'s Hiſtory of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> there have been ſo many learned Diſcourſes written of late on this Subject, and in particular two Anſwers to the Biſhops <hi>Book,</hi> that if it had not been thought expedient that I ſhould have caſt the whole matter into a ſhort Paper, I ſhould not have judged it neceſſary to trouble the world with more Diſcourſes on a ſubject that ſeems exhauſted. I will add no more, but that by the next I will give another Paper of the ſame Bulk upon the <hi>Idolatry of the Church of</hi> Rome.</p>

            <p>THE words of the <hi>Test,</hi> that belong to this Point, are theſe, <hi>The Invocation or Adoration of the Virgin</hi> Mary, <hi>or any other Saint, and the Sacrifice of the Maſs, as they are now uſed in the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>are Superſtitious and Idolatrous:</hi> Upon which our Author faſtens this Cenſure, <q rend="inline">That ſince by this the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is charged with <hi>Idolatry,</hi> which both forfeits Mens Lives here, and their Salvation hereafter, according to the expreſs words of Scripture, it is a damnable piece of Cruelty and Uncharitableneſs to load them with this Charge, if they are not guilty of it; and upon this he goes to clear them of it, not only in the two Articles mentioned in the <hi>Teſt,</hi> the Worſhip of <hi>Saints,</hi> and the Sacrifice of the <hi>Maſs,</hi> but that his <hi>Apology</hi> might be compleat, he takes in, and indeed inſiſts chiefly on the Worſhip of <hi>Images,</hi> tho that is not at all mentioned in the <hi>Teſt.</hi> He brings a great many Quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions out of the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> to ſhew the <hi>Idolatry</hi> prohibited in it, was the worſhipping of the Sun, Moon and Stars, or the making an <hi>Image</hi> to reſemble the Divine Eſſence, upon which he produces alſo ſome other Authorities:</q> And in this conſiſts the Subſtance of his <hi>Plea</hi> for the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But upon all this he ought to have retracted both the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe that himſelf gave ſome years ago, to Dr. <hi>Stillingfleets</hi> Book <hi>Of the Idolatry of the Church of</hi> Rome; and his own haſty Aſſertion in condemning both Turk <hi>and</hi> Papiſt <hi>as guilty of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry; the one for worſhipping a leud Impoſtor, and the other for worſhipping a ſenſeleſs piece of Matter.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Def. of his Eccl. Pol. p. 285, 286</note> It ſeems he is now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, that the latter part of this Charge that falls on <hi>Papiſts,</hi> was as falſe, as the former that falls on the <hi>Turks,</hi> certianly is; for
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:101251:118"/> they never worſhipped <hi>Mahomet,</hi> but hold him only in high Reverence, as an extraordinary Prophet, as the <hi>Jews</hi> do <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</hi> It is very like that, if the <hi>Turks</hi> had taken <hi>Vienna,</hi> he would have retracted that, as he has now in effect done the other; for I believe he is in the ſame Diſpoſition to reconcile himſelf to the <hi>Mufti,</hi> and the <hi>Pope:</hi> but the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire is now as low, as <hi>Popery</hi> is high; ſo he will brave the <hi>Turk</hi> ſtill to his Teeth, tho he did him wrong, and will humble himſelf to the <hi>Papiſt,</hi> tho he did him nothing but right; but now I take leave of the Man, and will confine my ſelf ſeverely to the matter that is before me: And</p>
            <p n="1">I. How guilty ſoever the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> yet the <hi>Test</hi> does not plainly aſſert that; for there is as great a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between <hi>Idolatrous</hi> and <hi>Idolatry,</hi> as there is in Law, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween what is <hi>Treaſonable,</hi> and what is <hi>Treaſon.</hi> The one Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports only a worſhip that is conformable to <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and that has a tendency to it; whereas the other is the plain Sin it ſelf; there is alſo a great deal of difference between what <hi>is now uſed in that Church,</hi> and the Explanations that ſome of their Doctors give of that uſage. We are to take the uſage of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> from her Publick <hi>Offices,</hi> and her authoriſed <hi>Practices;</hi> ſo that if <hi>theſe</hi> have a Conformity to <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and a tendency to it, then the words of the <hi>Teſt</hi> are juſtified, what Senſe ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſome learned Men among them may put on theſe <hi>Offices</hi> and <hi>Practices;</hi> therefore the <hi>Teſt</hi> may be well maintained, even tho we ſhould acknowledg that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was not guilty of <hi>Idolatry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. If <hi>Idolatry</hi> was a Crime puniſhable by <hi>Death</hi> under the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> that does not at all concern us; nor does the <hi>Charge</hi> of <hi>Idolatry</hi> authoriſe the People to kill all <hi>Idolaters:</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs our Author can prove, that we believe our ſelves to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all the Political and Judiciary Precepts of the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Moſes;</hi> and even among the <hi>Jews</hi> the Execution of that ſevere Law, belonging either to the Magiſtrate, or to ſome autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſed and inſpired Perſona, who as a Zealot might execute the Law, when the Magiſtrate was wanting to his Duty. So that this was writ invidiouſly, only as it ſeems to inflame the <hi>Papiſts</hi> the more againſt us. But the ſame <hi>Calviniſt Prince,</hi>
               <pb n="231" facs="tcp:101251:118"/> that has expreſſed ſo juſt an Averſion to the repealing the <hi>Teſt,</hi> has at the ſame time ſhewed ſo merciful an Inclination towards the <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> that of all the Reproaches in the World, one that intended to plead for that Religion ought to have avoided the mentioning of Blood or Cruelty with the greateſt care.</p>
            <p n="3">III. It is true, we cannot help believing that Idolatry is a damnable Sin, that ſhuts Men out of the Kingdom of Heaven; and if every Sin in which a Man dies without Repentance, does it, much more this, which is one of the greateſt of all Sins. But yet after all, there is Mercy for <hi>Sins of Ignorance,</hi> upon Mens general Repentance; and therefore, ſince God alone knows the degrees of Mens Knowledg, and of their Ignorance, and how far it is either <hi>Affected</hi> on the one hand, or <hi>Invincible</hi> on the other; we do not take upon us to enter into Gods Secrets, or to Judg of the Salvation or Damnation of particular Perſons; nor muſt we be byaſſed in our Enquiry into the nature of any Sin, either by a fond regard to the State of our Anceſtors, or by the due reſpect that we owe to thoſe who are over us in Civil Matters. In this Caſe, things are what God has declared them to be: we can neither make them better nor worſe than he has made them; and we are only to Judg of things, leaving Perſons to the merciful, as well as the juſt and dreadful Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. All the ſtir that our Author keeps with the examining of the <hi>Idolatry</hi> committed by the <hi>Jews,</hi> under the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> ſuppoſing it were all true, will ſerve no more for acquitting the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> than a Plea would avail a Criminal, who were arraigned of <hi>High Treaſon</hi> for Coyning Money, or for Countefeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Kings Seal, in which one ſhould ſet forth that <hi>High Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> was the <hi>Murdering the King, or the levying War againſt him;</hi> and that therefore the Criminal who was guilty of neither of theſe two, ought to be acquitted. <hi>Idolatry</hi> as well as <hi>Treaſon,</hi> is a comprehenſive Notion, and has many different Branches; ſo that tho the worſhipping the Hoſt of Heaven, or the worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping an Image as a Reſemblance of the Divinity, may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to be the higheſt degrees of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> yet many other Corruptions in the worſhip of God are juſtly reducible to it, and may be termed not only <hi>Idolatrous,</hi> but <hi>Idolatry</hi> it ſelf.</p>
            <pb n="232" facs="tcp:101251:119"/>
            <p n="5">V. Our Saviour in his Sermon on the Mount has ſhewed us how many ſins are reducible to the Second Table of the Law, beſides thoſe of <hi>Murder, Adultery, &amp;c.</hi> that are expreſly named in it: and tho the <hi>Jews</hi> in that time having delivered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves entirely from the ſin of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> to which their Fathers were ſo prone, gave him no occaſion of commenting on the firſt and ſecond <hi>Commandment;</hi> yet by the parity of things we may conclude, that many ſins are reducible to them, beſides thoſe that are expreſly named. And tho we have not ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat a Hiſtory of the <hi>Idolatry</hi> of the Neighbouring Nations to <hi>Judea,</hi> before the Captivity; yet we do certainly know what was the <hi>Idolatry</hi> of which the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> were guilty when the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> was writ. And tho the greateſt part of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> is written chiefly with relation to the <hi>Jews,</hi> whoſe freedom from <hi>Idolatry</hi> gave no occaſion to treat of it; yet in thoſe few paſſages which relate to the Heathen <hi>Idolatry</hi> then on foot, the holy Writers retain the ſame phraſes and ſtile, that were uſed in the <hi>Old Teſtament:</hi> which gives us juſt reaſon to believe, that the <hi>Idolatry</hi> was upon the matter and in its main ſtrokes the ſame under both: and if ſo, then we have a door opened to us to diſcover all our Author's falſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings: and upon this diſcovery we ſhall find that all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired Writers charged the Heathen Worſhip with <hi>Idolatry,</hi> not ſo much with relation to the gloſſes that Philoſophers and other political men might put on their <hi>Rites,</hi> but with relation to the practice in it ſelf.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. But ſince <hi>Idolatry</hi> is a ſin againſt a moral and unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Law, let us ſtate the True Notion of the right VVorſhip of God, and by Conſequence of <hi>Idolatry</hi> (tho this is done with that exactneſs by the worthy <hi>Maſter of the Temple,</hi> that it ſhould make a man afraid to come after him.) Our Ideas of God, and the homage of VVorſhip and Service that we offer up purſuant to theſe, are not only to be conſidered as they are juſt thoughts of God, and Acts ſuitable to thoſe thoughts; but as they are Ideas that tend both to elevate and purifie our own natures: for the thoughts of God are the ſeeds of all Truth and Virtue in us, which being deeply rooted in us, make us become <hi>conformable to the Divine Nature.</hi> So that the ſin of <hi>Idolatry</hi> conſiſts in this, that our Ideas of God being corrupted,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:101251:119"/> he is either defrauded of that honour, which, tho due to him, is transferred to another; or is diſhonoured by a worſhip that is unſuitable to his nature; and we alſo by forming wrong Ideas of the object of our VVorſhip, become corrupted by them. Nothing raiſes the ſoul of Man more than ſublime thoughts of God's Greatneſs and Glory: and nothing perfects it more, than juſt notions of his VViſdom and Goodneſs. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, nothing debaſes our natures more, than the offering our VVorſhip and Service to a Being that is low and unworthy of it: or the depreſſing the ſupream Being in our thoughts or wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, to ſomewhat that is like our ſelves, or perhaps worſe. Therefore the deſign of true Religion being the forming in us ſuch notions as may exalt and ſanctify our natures, as well as the raiſing a Tribute to the Author of our being, that is in ſome ſort worthy of him, the ſin of <hi>Idolatry</hi> is upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count chiefly forbidden in Scripture, becauſe it corrupts our Ideas of God, and by a natural tendency this muſt likewiſe corrupt our natures, when we either raiſe up an <hi>Idol</hi> ſo far in our thoughts, as to fancy it a <hi>God,</hi> or depreſs <hi>God</hi> ſo far as to make him an <hi>Idol;</hi> for theſe two Species of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> have both the ſame effect on us. And as a wound in a Man's vitals, is much more deſtructive than any, how deep and dangerous ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that is in his limbs; ſince it is poſſible for him to recover of the one, but not of the other; ſo <hi>Idolatry</hi> corrupts Religion in its ſource. Thus <hi>Idolatry</hi> in its moral and unchangeable na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is the Honouring any Creature as a God, or the Imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that God is ſuch a being as the other Creatures are: and this had been a ſin, tho no Law againſt it had ever been given to mankind, but the light and law of nature.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. But after all this, there are different degrees in this ſin; for the true notion of God being this, that he comprehends all perfections in his eſſence; the aſcribing all theſe to a Creature, is the higheſt degree of <hi>Idolatry:</hi> but the aſcribing any one of theſe Infinite perfections, (or which is all one with relation to our actions) the doing any thing which <hi>Imports,</hi> or is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to <hi>Import</hi> it, is likewiſe <hi>Idolatry,</hi> tho of a lower degree of guilt; ſo likewiſe the Imagining that the true God is no other than as an Idol repreſents him to be, is the higheſt degree of the other ſpecies of <hi>Idolatry;</hi> but the conceiving him as having a
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:101251:120"/> Body in which his Eternal mind dwells, or fancying that any ſtrange Virtue from him dwells in any Body to ſuch a degree, as to make that Body the proper object of Worſhip, unleſs he has aſſured us that he is really united to that Body, and dwells in it, which was the caſe of the <hi>Cloud of Glory</hi> under the <hi>Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament,</hi> and much more of the <hi>humane nature of Chriſt</hi> under the <hi>New;</hi> this is likewiſe <hi>Idolatry.</hi> For in all theſe, it is plain that the true Ideas of <hi>God,</hi> and the Principles of Religion are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. There are two principles in the nature of man that make him very apt to fall into <hi>Idolatry,</hi> either inward or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. The firſt is the weakneſs of moſt peoples minds, which are ſo ſunk into groſs phantaſms and ſenſible objects, that they are ſcarce capable to raiſe their thoughts to pure and ſpiritual Ideas: and therefore they are apt either to forget Religion quite, or to entertain it by objects that are viſible and ſenſible: the other is, that mens appetites and paſſions being for the moſt part too ſtrong for them, and theſe not being reconcilable to the true Ideas of a pure and Spiritual Eſſence, they are eaſily diſpoſed to embrace ſuch notions of God as may live more peaceably with their vices: and ſo they hope by a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of expence and honour, or of fury and rage, which they Imploy in the Worſhip of an Imaginary Deity, to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe their pardons, and to compenſate for their other crimes, if not to authoriſe them.</p>
            <p>Theſe two principles, that are ſo rooted in our frail and corrupt natures, being wrought on by the craft and authority of ambitions and covetous men, who are never wanting in all Ages and Nations, have brought forth all that <hi>Idolatry,</hi> that has appeared in ſo many different ſhapes up and down the World, and has been diverſified according to the various tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, accidents and Conſtitutions of the ſeveral Nations and Ages of the World.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. I now come to examine the beginnings of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> as they are repreſented to us in the Scripture, in which it will appear, that our Authors account of it ſhews him guilty, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of great Ignorance, or of that which is worſe. <q rend="inline">He pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends that the firſt plain Intimation, that we have of it in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtine,</hi> is when <hi>Jacob</hi> after his converſation with the <hi>Schiche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites,</hi>
                  <pb n="235" facs="tcp:101251:120"/> commanded his family to put away their <hi>Strange Gods.</hi>
               </q> VVhereas we have an earlier and more particular account of thoſe <hi>Strange Gods</hi> in the ſame Book of <hi>Geneſis, Chap.</hi> 31. where when <hi>Jacob</hi> fled away from <hi>Laban,</hi> it is ſaid, Verſ. 19. that <hi>Rachel</hi> ſtole her fathers <hi>Images</hi> or <hi>Tera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phim:</hi> and theſe are afterwards called by <hi>Laban</hi> his <hi>Gods,</hi> verſ. 30. and theſe very <hi>Images</hi> are called by <hi>Joſhua</hi> 24.2. <hi>Strange Gods:</hi> So that the <hi>Strange Gods,</hi> from which <hi>Jacob</hi> cleanſed his family, <hi>Gen.</hi> 35.2. were no other than the <hi>Teraphim;</hi> and that in the <hi>Teraphim,</hi> we are to ſeek for the true Original of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and for the ſenſe of the phraſe of <hi>other Gods,</hi> or <hi>Strange Gods,</hi> which is indeed the true key to this whole matter.</p>
            <p>Theſe were little ſtatues, ſuch as the <hi>Dii lares</hi> or <hi>Penates</hi> were afterwards among the <hi>Romans,</hi> or the <hi>Pagods</hi> now in the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> in which it was believed, that there was ſuch a divine vertue ſhut up, that the <hi>Idolaters</hi> expected protection from them. And as people in all times are apt to truſt to <hi>Charms,</hi> ſo thoſe who pretended to chain down the Divine Influences to thoſe <hi>Images,</hi> had here a great occaſion given them to deceive the world; of this ſort was the <hi>Palladium</hi> of <hi>Troy,</hi> and the <hi>Ancelle</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> And this gave the riſe to all the cheats of <hi>Teleſmes</hi> and <hi>Taliſmans</hi> that came afterwards. Theſe were of different figures: and ſince our Author confeſſes p. 124. that <hi>Cherubim</hi> and <hi>Teraphim</hi> are ſometimes uſed promiſcuouſly for one another, it is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that the figure of both was the ſame; and ſince it is plain from <hi>Ezekiel</hi> that the <hi>Cherubim</hi> reſembled a Calf (Compare <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1.10. with <hi>chap.</hi> 10.14. where what is called in the firſt the face of an <hi>Ox,</hi> is called in the other the face of a <hi>Cherub</hi>) from hence it is probable that the <hi>Teraphim,</hi> or at leaſt ſome of them, were of the ſame figure. In theſe it was alſo believed, that there were different degrees of Charms; ſome were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved ſtronger than others: So that probably <hi>Pharaoh</hi> thought that <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> had a <hi>Teraphim</hi> of greater virtue than his <hi>Magicians</hi> had, which is the cleareſt account that I know of his hardening his heart againſt ſo many Miracles: and this alſo ſeems to be the firſt occaſion of the phraſe of the <hi>Gods of the ſeveral Nations,</hi> and of ſome being ſtronger than other: that is, the <hi>Teraphim</hi> of the one were believed to have a higher degree of enchantment in them, than the others had.</p>
            <pb n="236" facs="tcp:101251:121"/>
            <p>This then leads us to the right Notion of <hi>Aaron</hi>'s <hi>Golden Calf,</hi> and of the terms of <hi>graven</hi> or <hi>carved Images</hi> in the Second Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, and even of the <hi>other Gods</hi> in the firſt Commandment: for we have ſeen that both in the Stile of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Joſhua,</hi> the <hi>Images</hi> were thoſe <hi>Teraphim,</hi> which they alſo called ſtrange <hi>Gods.</hi> When the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> thought that <hi>Moſes</hi> had forſaken them, they came to <hi>Aaron</hi> deſiring him to make them <hi>gods,</hi> that is, <hi>Teraphims;</hi> yet they preſcribed no form to him, but left that wholly to him; and ſo the dream of their fondneſs of the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Idolatry</hi> vaniſhes; for it was <hi>Aarons</hi> choice that made it a <hi>Calf;</hi> perhaps he had ſeen the <hi>Divine Glory,</hi> as a Cloud between the <hi>Cherubims</hi> when he went up into the Mountain, <hi>Exod.</hi> 24.9, 10. For a <hi>Pattern</hi> being ſhewed to <hi>Moſes</hi> of the Tabernacle that he was to make; it is probable, <hi>Aaron</hi> ſaw that likewiſe, and this might diſpoſe him to give them a <hi>Seraphim</hi> in that Figure; this is alſo the moſt probable account both of the Calves of <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi> ſet up by <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> and alſo of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping the <hi>Ephod</hi> that <hi>Gideon</hi> made, <hi>Judg.</hi> 8.27. of the Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of <hi>Micah</hi> and the <hi>Danites,</hi> who robbed him, <hi>Judg.</hi> 17.18. and of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> offering Incenſe to the Brazen Serpent, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.4. which ſeemed to have all the Solemnities of a <hi>Teraphim</hi> in it; ſo that it is plain, the greateſt part of the <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi> under the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> was the worſhip of the <hi>Tera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phim.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">X. But to compleat this Argument with relation to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Point, it is no leſs plain, that the true <hi>Jehovah</hi> was Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped in thoſe <hi>Teraphim.</hi> To begin with the firſt. It is clear that <hi>Laban</hi> in the Covenant that he made with <hi>Jacob,</hi> appeals not only to the <hi>God of Abraham, Gen.</hi> 31.53. but likewiſe to <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah, v.</hi> 49. for tho that name was not then known, yet <hi>Moſes</hi> by uſing it on that occaſion, ſhews us plainly, that <hi>Laban</hi> was a VVorſhipper of the true God. <hi>Aaron</hi> ſhews the ſame by intimating that Feaſt, which he appointed to <hi>Jehovah, Exod.</hi> 32.5. (which our Author thought not fit to mention) the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple alſo by calling theſe, <hi>v.</hi> 4. <hi>the Gods that brought them out of Egypt,</hi> ſhew that they had no thoughts of the <hi>Egyptian Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;</hi> but they believed that <hi>Moſes</hi> had carried away the <hi>Tera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phim,</hi> in the vertue of which it ſeems they fancied, that he had wrought his Miracles; and that <hi>Aaron,</hi> who they believed
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:101251:121"/> knew the Secret, had made them new ones; and this is the moſt probable account of their joy in celebrating that Feaſt. And as for <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> the caſe ſeems to be plainly the ſame; he made the People believe that the <hi>Teraphim,</hi> which he gave them in <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi> were as good as thoſe that were at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> For as his deſign was no other than to hinder their going thither, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 12.27. ſo it is not likely, that either he would, or durſt venture upon a total Change of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; or that it could have paſſed ſo eaſily with the People; whereas the other had nothing extraordinary in it. It is alſo plain, that as <hi>Jeroboam</hi> called the Calves the <hi>Gods that brought them out of Egypt, v.</hi> 28. ſo he ſtill acknowledged the true <hi>Jehovah;</hi> for the Prophets both true and falſe in his time pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied in the name of <hi>Jehovah,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 13.2, 18, 26. and when his Son was Sick, he ſent his Wife to the Prophet <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah, c.</hi> 14. The Story of the new <hi>Idolatry,</hi> that <hi>Achab</hi> ſet up of the <hi>Baalim,</hi> ſhews alſo plainly, that the old Worſhippers of the <hi>Calves,</hi> adhered to the true <hi>Jehovah;</hi> for <hi>Elijah</hi> ſtates the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as if the Nation had been divided between <hi>Jehovah</hi> and <hi>Baal,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.21, 39. And the whole Story of <hi>Jehu</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms this, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 9.6, 12, 36. he was <hi>Anointed King</hi> in the Name of <hi>Jehovah;</hi> and as ſoon as the Captains that were with him, knew this, they acknowledged him <hi>their King;</hi> he like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſpeaking of the Fact of the Men of <hi>Samaria,</hi> cites the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of <hi>Jehovah,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 10 10, 16, 29. which ſhews that the People acknowledged it ſtill: and he called his Zeal againſt the worſhip of <hi>Baal,</hi> his Zeal for <hi>Jehovah,</hi> and yet, both he and his Party worſhipped the <hi>Calves.</hi> It is no leſs clear that <hi>Micah,</hi> who called the <hi>Teraphim</hi> his <hi>Gods, Judges</hi> 18.24. was a Worſhipper of the true <hi>Jehovah, Judges</hi> 17.13. and there is little reaſon to doubt that this was the caſe of <hi>Gideons Ephod,</hi> and of the <hi>Brazen Serpent.</hi> It were needleſs to go about the proving, that all theſe corrupt ways of worſhip were <hi>Idolatrous;</hi> the <hi>Calf</hi> is expreſly called an <hi>Idol</hi> by St. <hi>Stephen, Acts</hi> 7.41. and the thing is ſo plain, that it is denied by none that I know of; ſo here we have a Species of <hi>Idolatry</hi> plainly ſet forth in Scripture, in which the <hi>true God</hi> was worſhipped in an <hi>Image;</hi> and I fancy it is ſcarce neceſſary to inform the Reader, that wherever he finds LORD in Capitals in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bible, it is for <hi>Jehovah</hi> in the <hi>Hebrew.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="238" facs="tcp:101251:122"/>
            <p n="11">XI. It is very true that the great and prevailing <hi>Idolatry</hi> of all the <hi>Eaſt</hi> grew to be the worſhip of the <hi>Hoſt of Heaven,</hi> which ſeems to have riſen very naturally out of the other <hi>Idolatry</hi> of the <hi>Teraphim,</hi> which probably was the Ancienter of the two. For when men came to think that Divine Influences were tied to ſuch <hi>Images,</hi> it was very natural for them to fancy, that a more Soverain Degree of Influence was in the <hi>Sun,</hi> and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence that he deſerved Divine Adoration much more than their poor little <hi>Teraphim.</hi> But it is alſo clear, that this Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, which they offer to the <hi>Sun,</hi> was not with Relation to the matter of that ſhining Body, but to the Divinity which they believed was lodged in it. This appears not only from the <hi>Greek</hi> writters, <hi>Zenophon</hi> and <hi>Plutarch,</hi> but from the greateſt Antiquity that now is in the VVorld; the <hi>Bas reliefs</hi> that are in the ruins of the Temple of <hi>Perſepolis,</hi> which are deſcribed with ſo much coſt and care, by that Worthy and Learned Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Sir <hi>John Chardin,</hi> and which the World expects ſo gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily from him; He favoured me with a ſight of them, and in theſe it appears, that in their Triumphs, of which a whole Series remains entire, they carried not only the <hi>Fire,</hi> which was the Emblem of the Body of the <hi>Sun,</hi> but after that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem of the <hi>Divinity</hi> that it ſeems they thought was in it, under the Repreſentation of a <hi>Head environed with Clouds,</hi> which is the moſt natural Emblem that we can fancy of an Intelligent, and an Incomprehenſible Being. It is true, as <hi>Idolatry</hi> grows ſtill groſſer and groſſer, the Intelligent Being was at laſt forgot, tho it ſeems it was remembred by their Philoſophers, ſince the <hi>Greeks</hi> came to know it, and all their Worſhip was paid to the <hi>Sun,</hi> or to his Emblem the <hi>Fire;</hi> ſo that even this <hi>Idolatry</hi> was moſt probably the Worſhip of the true God at firſt, under a viſible Repreſentation. And that this was an effect of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <hi>Idolatry,</hi> is confirmed from what is ſaid by <hi>Moſes, Deut.</hi> 4.14, to 19. where he plainly intimates the progreſs that <hi>Idolatry</hi> would have, if they once came to worſhip <hi>graven or molten Images,</hi> or make any ſort of <hi>Similtude</hi> for the Great God; this would carry them, to <hi>lift up their Eyes to Heaven, and Worſhip and Serve the Hoſt of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="12">XII. The next ſhape that <hi>Idolatry</hi> took, was the worſhipping ſome ſubordinate Spirits, their <hi>Genii,</hi> which were in effect <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi>
               <pb n="239" facs="tcp:101251:122"/> or <hi>departed Men and Women,</hi> and this filled both <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> and was the prevailing <hi>Idolatry</hi> when the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> was writ. But that all theſe Nations believed ſtill one <hi>Supream God,</hi> and that they conſidered theſe juſt as the <hi>Roman Church</hi> does now <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Saints, (mutatis mutandis)</hi> has been made out ſo invincibly, by the Learned Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> that one would rather think that he had over charged his Argument with too much proof, than that it is any way defective. And yet this Worſhip of thoſe ſecondary Deities is charged with <hi>Idolatry,</hi> both in the <hi>Acts,</hi> and in the <hi>Epiſtles,</hi> ſo often, that it is plain, the Inſpired Writers believed, that the giving any degrees of divine worſhip to a Creature, tho in a ſubordinate Form, was <hi>Idolatry;</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives us a Comprehenſive Notion of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> that it was the giving <hi>Divine Service</hi> (the word is <hi>Dulia</hi>) to thoſe that by <hi>nature were not Gods, Gal.</hi> 4.8. and he throws off all <hi>Lords,</hi> as well as all the <hi>Gods</hi> of the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then</hi> as <hi>Idols,</hi> and in oppoſition to theſe, reduces the VVorſhip of Chriſtians to the Object of one God the Father, and of one <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.5, 6. So that the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman Idolatry</hi> being ſtrictly that which is condemned in the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> of which we have ſuch a copious Evidence from their writings, it is plain, that even inferior degrees of worſhip, when offered up to Creatures, tho Angels, is <hi>Idolatry;</hi> and tho the <hi>Heathens</hi> thought neither <hi>Jupiter</hi> nor <hi>Mercury</hi> the Supream Deities, yet the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> did not for all that forebear to call them <hi>Idols, Acts</hi> 14.15.</p>
            <p n="13">XIII. Our Author pretends to bear a great reſpect to Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity: And therefore I might in the next place, ſend him to all that the <hi>Fathers</hi> have writ againſt the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi> in which he will find that the <hi>Heathens</hi> had their <hi>Explai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> as well as the Church old <hi>Rome</hi> has. They denied they worſhipped their <hi>Images;</hi> but ſaid, they made uſe of them on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to raiſe up their Minds by thoſe viſible Objects; yet as St. <hi>Paul</hi> begun the charge againſt the <hi>Athenians</hi> of Idolatry, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.29. for their <hi>Gods of gold and ſilver, wood and ſtone;</hi> ſo it was ſtill kept up, and often repeated by the Fathers, tho the Philoſophers might have thrown it back upon them, with all that Pomp of dreadful words, which our Author makes uſe of, againſt thoſe that faſten the ſame Charge upon the <hi>Church</hi> of
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:101251:123"/> 
               <hi>Rome.</hi> The ſame might be ſaid with relation to the <hi>Fathers,</hi> accuſing them of <hi>Polytheiſm,</hi> in worſhipping many Gods, and of <hi>Idolatry</hi> in worſhipping thoſe that had been but Men like themſelves. For it is plain, that at leaſt all the Philoſophers and wiſe Men believed, that theſe were only deputed by the Great God, to govern ſome Countrys and Cities; and that they were Mediators and Interceſſors between God and Men. But all this, that appears ſo fully in <hi>Celſus, Porphyry,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others, did not make the Fathers give over the Charge; Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> has given ſuch full Proofs of this, that nothing can be made plainer than the matter of Fact is. We know likewiſe, that when the Controverſy aroſe concerning the Godhead of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Athanaſius</hi> and the other <hi>Fathers</hi> made uſe of the ſame Argument againſt the <hi>Arrians,</hi> who wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped him; that they could not be excuſed from the Sin of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> in worſhipping and invocating him, whom they belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be only a Creature; which ſhews, that it was the Senſe of the Chriſtians of that Age, that all Acts of Divine Worſhip, and in particular, all Prayers that were offered up to any that was not truly, and by nature <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>Eternal God,</hi> were ſo many Acts of <hi>Idolatry.</hi> So that upon the whole matter, it is clear, that the Worſhipping the true <hi>God</hi> under a Corporeal Repreſentation, and the worſhipping or Invocating of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, tho in an inferior degree, was taxed by the Apoſtles, and by the Primitive Church, as <hi>Idolatrous.</hi> When they accuſe them for thoſe Corruptions of Divine Worſhip, they did not conſider the ſoftning Excuſes of more refined Men, ſo much as the Acts that were done, which to be ſure do always carry the ſtupid Vulgar to the groſſeſt degrees of <hi>Idolatry;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore every ſtep towards it, is ſo ſeverely forbid by God; ſince upon one Step made in the publick Worſhip, the People are ſure to make a great many more in their Notions of things. Therefore if we ſhould accuſe the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> for all the Exceſſes of the paſt Ages, or of the more Ignorant <hi>Nations</hi> in the preſent Age, ſuch as <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Portugal,</hi> even this might be in ſome degree well grounded; becauſe the publick and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized <hi>Offices</hi> and <hi>Practices</hi> of that <hi>Church,</hi> has given the riſe to all thoſe Diſorders; and even in this, we ſhould but Copy after the <hi>Fathers,</hi> who always repreſent the <hi>Pagan Idolatry,</hi>
               <pb n="241" facs="tcp:101251:123"/> not as <hi>Cicero</hi> or <hi>Plutarch</hi> had done it, but according to the groſſeſt notions and practices of the Vulgar.</p>
            <p n="14">XIV. All that our Author ſays concerning the <hi>Cherubims,</hi> deſerves not an anſwer; for what uſe ſoever might be made of this, to excuſe the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> for the uſe of <hi>Images,</hi> without worſhipping them (tho after all, the doing ſuch a thing upon a Divine Command, and the doing it without a Command, are two very different things) yet it cannot belong to the worſhip of <hi>Images,</hi> ſince the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> payed no worſhip to the <hi>Cherubims.</hi> They pay'd indeed a Divine worſhip to the <hi>Cloud of Glory,</hi> which was between them, and which is often in the Old Teſtament called <hi>God</hi> himſelf, in all thoſe expreſſions in which he is ſaid to <hi>dwell between the Cherubims.</hi> But this being a miraculous Symbole of the Divine preſence, from which they had anſwers in all extraordinary caſes, it was God himſelf, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Image or Repreſentation, that was worſhipped in it. As we Chriſtians pay our Adorations to the <hi>Humane Nature</hi> of Chriſt, by vertue of that more ſublime and ineffable indwelling of the <hi>Godhead</hi> in Him: in which caſe it is God only that we worſhip, in the <hi>man Chriſt.</hi> Even as the reſpect that we pay to a man terminates in his <hi>mind,</hi> tho the outward expreſſions of it go to the <hi>body,</hi> to which the mind is united. So in that unconceivable Union between the Divine and Humane Natures in Chriſt, we adore the <hi>Godhead</hi> only, even when we worſhip the <hi>man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="15">XV. The General part of this Diſcourſe being thus ſtated, the application of it to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> will be no hard matter. I will not inſiſt much on the Article of <hi>Image Worſhip,</hi> becauſe it is not comprehended in the <hi>Teſt,</hi> tho our Author dwells longeſt on it, to let us ſee how carefully, but to how little purpoſe he had read Dr. <hi>Spencer</hi>'s Learned Book. But if one conſiders the Ceremonies and Prayers with which <hi>Images,</hi> and particularly <hi>Croſſes,</hi> are to be dedicated by the <hi>Roman Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifical,</hi> and the formal Adoration of the <hi>Croſs</hi> on <hi>Good-Friday,</hi> and the ſtrange vertues that are not only believed to be in ſome <hi>Images</hi> by the rabble, but that are authorized not only by the Books of Devotion publickly allowed among them, but even by Papal <hi>Bulls</hi> and <hi>Indulgences,</hi> he will be forced to confeſs, that the old notions of the <hi>Teraphim</hi> are clearly revived among
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:101251:124"/> them. This could be made out in an infinite Induction of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, of which the Reader will find a large account in the Learned Dr. <hi>Brevint</hi>'s Treatiſe, entitled, <hi>Saul and Samuel at Endor.</hi> But I come now to the two Branches mentioned in the <hi>Teſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="16">XVI. One is the <hi>Sacrifice of the Maſs,</hi> in which if either our <hi>Senſes,</hi> that tell us, it is now <hi>Bread and Wine,</hi> or the <hi>New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> in which it is called both <hi>Bread</hi> and the <hi>fruit of the Vine,</hi> even after the Conſecration, or if the Opinion of the firſt <hi>ſeven Centuries,</hi> or if the true principles of <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> concurring al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together, are ſtrong enough, we are as certain as it is poſſible for us to be of any thing, that they are ſtill according to our Authors own phraſe, <hi>a ſenſeleſs piece of matter.</hi> VVhen there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this has Divine <hi>Adoration</hi> offered to it; when it is called, the <hi>good God,</hi> carried about in ſolemn Proceſſions, and receives as publick and as humble a Veneration, as could be offered up to the Deity it ſelf, if it appeared viſibly: here the higheſt degree of Divine worſhip is offered up to a Creature; nor will ſuch worſhippers, believing this to be truely the Body of Chriſt, ſave the matter, if indeed it is not ſo. This may no doubt go a great way to ſave themſelves, and to bring their ſin into the Claſs of the ſins of Ignorance; but what large thought ſoever we may have of the mercies of God to their perſons, we can have no Indulgence for an act of Divine <hi>Adoration,</hi> which is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to an Object that we are either ſure is <hi>Bread,</hi> or we are ſure of nothing elſe.</p>
            <p n="17">XVII. As for the <hi>Invocation and Adoration of the Bleſſed Virgin and the Saints,</hi> I ſhall offer only three Claſſes of Inſtances to prove it <hi>Idolatrous.</hi> 1. In the <hi>Office</hi> of the <hi>Maſs</hi> on many of the <hi>Saints days,</hi> that <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> which is no other than the <hi>Body and Blood of Chriſt,</hi> according to them, is offered up to the honour of the <hi>Saints,</hi> and they pray to God to accept of it through the Saints Interceſſion. One would think, it were enough to offer up the <hi>Sacrifices</hi> of prayers and praiſes to them: but here is a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> which carries in the plain words of it, the moſt abſurd <hi>Idolatry</hi> that is poſſible; which is the offering up the <hi>Creator</hi> to the honour of a <hi>Creature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. In the Prayers and Hymns that are in their publick <hi>Offices,</hi> there are Petitions offered up to the Saints, that in the plain
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:101251:124"/> ſenſe of the words import their pardoning our ſins, and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging our hearts. The dayly prayer to the <hi>Virgin</hi> goes far this way: <hi>Tu nos ab hoſte protege, &amp; hora mortis ſuſcipe:</hi> Do thou protect us from our Enemy, and receive us in the hour of death. Another goes yet further: <hi>Culpas noſtras ablue, ut perennis ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem gloriae, per te redempti, valeamus ſcandere:</hi> VVaſh thou away our ſins, that ſo being redeemed by thee, we may aſcend up to the manſions of glory. That to the <hi>Angels</hi> is of the ſame nature, <hi>Noſtra diluant jam peccata praeſtando ſupernam Coeli gloriam:</hi> May they waſh away our ſins, and grant us the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly glory. I ſhall to this add two Addreſſes to two of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Saints; the firſt is to St. <hi>Alban, Te nunc petimus Patrone praeco ſedule, qui es noſtra vera gloria, ſolve precum votis, ſervo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum ſcelera:</hi> We implore thee, our Patron, who art our true Glory, do thou take away the crimes of thy Servants, by thy Prayers. And the other relates to <hi>Thomas Becket,</hi> whom I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, our Author will not deny to have been as great a Rebel, as either <hi>Coligny,</hi> or his Faction: and yet they pray thus to Chriſt, <hi>Tu per Thomae ſanguinem, quem pro te effudit, fac nos Chriſte ſcandere quo Thomas aſcendit.</hi> Do thou, O Chriſt, make us by the <hi>blood of Thomas, which he ſhed for thee,</hi> to aſcend up whither he has aſcended: And the Hymn upon him, is that Verſe of the Eighth Pſalm, <hi>Thou haſt crowned him with Glory and Honour, and has ſet him over all the works of thy hands.</hi> One would think, it were no bold thing to pronounce all this, and innumerable more Inſtances, which might be brought to the ſame purpoſe, to be <hi>Idolatrous.</hi> If we are ſent by our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor to the ſenſes that may be put on theſe words, I ſhall only ſay with relation to that, that the <hi>Teſt</hi> condemns the Devotions as <hi>they are uſed in the Roman Church:</hi> ſo this belongs to the plain ſenſe of the words; and if it is confeſſed that theſe are <hi>Idolatrous,</hi> as aſcribing to Creatures the right of pardoning ſin, and of opening the Kingdom of Heaven, which are main parts of the Divine Glory, then the matter of the <hi>Teſt</hi> is juſtified.</p>
            <p>A Third ſort of Inſtance is in the Prayer that comes after the Prieſt has pronounced the words of Abſolution, <hi>Paſſio Domini noſtri Jeſu Chriſti, merita B. Mariae Virginis, &amp; omnium Sancto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, &amp; quicquid boni feceris, vel mali ſuſtinueris, ſint tibi in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſionem peccatorum, augmentum gratiae, &amp; premium vitae eternae:</hi>
               <pb n="244" facs="tcp:101251:125"/> May the Paſſion of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Merits of the B. Virgin, and all the Saints, and all the good thou haſt done, or the evil that thou haſt ſuffered, be to thee effectual, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of thy ſins, the encreaſe of grace, and the reward of Eternal life. <hi>Abſolution</hi> in its true and unſophiſticated mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, being the declaration made to a Penitent of the Mercies of God in Chriſt, according to the Goſpel, I would gladly know, what milder cenſure is due to the mixing the merits of the <hi>Virgin</hi> and the <hi>Saints,</hi> with the Paſſion of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in order to the obtaining this Goſpel Pardon, with all the effects of it, than this of our <hi>Teſt,</hi> that it is <hi>Idolatrous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have now examined the two points, in which our Author thought fit to make an <hi>Apology</hi> for the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out deſcending to the particulars of his <hi>Plea</hi> more minutely. I have uſed him in this more gently than he deſerves; for as I examined his <hi>Reaſonings,</hi> I found all along both ſo much Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, and ſuch groſs diſingenuity, that I had ſome difficulty to reſtrain my ſelf from flying out on many occaſions: But I reſolved to purſue theſe two points, with the gravity of ſtile which the matter required, without entangling the diſcourſe with ſuch unpleaſant digreſſions, as the diſcovery of his <hi>Errors</hi> might have led me to. And I thought it enough to free un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wary Readers from the miſtakes into which his Book might lead them, without encreaſing the contempt belonging to the Writer, who has now enough upon him; but I pray God grant him Repentance and a better mind.</p>
